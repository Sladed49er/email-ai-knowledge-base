 4   Introduc-on:  Welcome to "Cybersecurity for Insurance Agency Owners," your trusty guide to naviga;ng the digital mineﬁeld of cyber threats and regula;ons while s;ll maintaining your sanity and sense of humor. Aber all, dealing with hackers and cybercriminals doesn't have to be as dull as reading through an insurance policy wriTen in a foreign language!  As an insurance agency owner, you understand the value of safeguarding your clients' sensi;ve informa;on. But in today's interconnected world, it's not just about locking ﬁle cabinets and shredding documents—cybersecurity is a vital component of your agency's overall risk management strategy.  In this book, we'll explore the ins and outs of cybersecurity with a par;cular focus on the insurance industry. It will cover everything from common cyber threats and government regula;ons to best prac;ces and strategies for preven;on and remedia;on. And, because I know you're busy, I promise to keep things light and engaging.  So, buckle up and grab your favorite caﬀeinated beverage (or adult beverage, I don't judge) as we embark on this thrilling and informa;ve journey through the world of cybersecurity for insurance agency owners. Remember, it's not just about protec;ng your boTom line—it's about safeguarding your clients' trust.   

 5 Chapter 1: Why This Book?  Imagine waking up one day to ﬁnd that your fridge is sending spam emails and your toaster is plolng a cyber-aTack. In today's world, such scenarios are not as far-fetched as they may seem. It's more important than ever for insurance professionals to have a comprehensive understanding of cyber security challenges. However, ﬁnding a resource tailored speciﬁcally to the insurance industry has been as diﬃcult as explaining the cloud to your grandparents. As a result of this gap in the market, this book aims to ﬁll that void, providing insurance professionals with a unique, specialized perspec;ve that combines industry-speciﬁc knowledge with technical exper;se. While the topic of cyber security may seem daun;ng, I hoped to use humor to make the content more approachable and enjoyable. Aber all, laughter is the best medicine for countering the stress of poten;al cyber threats.  One note that would go well here, is that the days of managing your own IT internally are over.  There is no way any individual can prac;ce and keep up with compliances on both Insurance and on the IT side of the house.  You should either have a third party such as an MSP or internal IT staﬀ.  The rapid changes and the risk of lost data far exceed the desire to save a buck!  Sorry, Aunt Peggy should not be both recep;onist and IT troubleshooter.  I write this book with the assump;on that you already have one of the aforemen;oned IT Staﬀ, (EXCLUSIVELY IT!) or an MSP…if not, do kindly get one.  I’d be happy to suggest a few that work exclusively with Insurance Agents.  I’ll make sure you’re in good hands…no pun intended for royalty reasons.  This book is a guide and only that.  This is to help you eﬀec-vely guide and be knowledgeable enough to discuss proper course of ac-on with your IT or MSP. This is the Mission Statement of the guide, and my “Why”.  Too oben we check the box that we have an MSP or believe our IT Staﬀ is keeping us safe, however we need to know they are doing as they say.  If you knew a carrier was not going to pay out on claims, you would not put a client with them.  I’m hoping to equip you to be able to ask the right ques;ons to avoid possible pitalls and snake oil salesmen!  With this in mind, I invite readers to join on a journey where you'll learn to protect your business and customers from poten;al threats. Remember, a well-informed insurance professional who can laugh in the face of cyber risks is the best line of defense in this digital age.     

 6 Chapter 2: Understanding Cybersecurity Basics  Where There's a Will, There's a Hacker  Welcome to the world of cybersecurity, where mysterious ﬁgures in hoodies hunch over keyboards, typing furiously as they aTempt to break into your insurance agency's treasure trove of data. While that may be a slight exaggera;on, the reality is that there are people out there who would love nothing more than to get their hands on your clients' sensi;ve informa;on. But fear not, dear reader! I’m here to help you understand the basics of cybersecurity so that you can keep those cyber rascals at bay.  Sec1on 2.1: What is Cybersecurity?  Cybersecurity is the prac;ce of protec;ng computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from digital aTacks, damage, or unauthorized access. In the context of insurance agencies, cybersecurity involves safeguarding client informa;on, ﬁnancial data, and other sensi;ve informa;on that your business processes and stores.  Sec1on 2.2: The CIA Triad - Conﬁden1ality, Integrity, and Availability  No, I’m not talking about a secre;ve government organiza;on here. The CIA triad is a fundamental concept in cybersecurity, comprising three key principles:  • Ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensi;ve informa;on. Think of it like a secret recipe that only you and your trusted chef know. • Integrity - Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data over its lifecycle. In other words, making sure no one tampers with your grandma's famous meatloaf recipe. • Availability - Ensuring that informa;on and systems are accessible to authorized users when they need them. Because what good is a secret recipe if you can't ﬁnd it when it's ;me to cook?  By adhering to these principles, you can create a strong founda;on for your agency's cybersecurity eﬀorts.  Sec1on 2.3: Layers of Cybersecurity  Much like a delicious, mul;-layered cake, cybersecurity consists of several layers designed to protect your agency from diﬀerent types of threats. These layers include:  Physical Security - Measures taken to protect your physical devices, such as access control systems, security cameras, and secure disposal of old equipment. Depending on your oﬃce situa;on, some of course will apply while other wont.  For example, if the 2020 dumpster ﬁre year ended up moving you into a hybrid or remote only situa;on, of course access control would not be necessary. 

 7  Access control systems:  • Implement a mul;-factor authen;ca;on system for access to sensi;ve areas, requiring both a physical ID card and a unique personal iden;ﬁca;on number (PIN) or biometric authen;ca;on. • Periodically review and update access privileges to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to restricted areas. • Install alarms on doors and windows that alert security personnel if an unauthorized entry is aTempted.  Security cameras:  • Make sure cameras are placed strategically to cover all entry points and sensi;ve areas, making sure there are no blind spots. • Regularly maintain and test the security cameras to ensure they are func;oning properly. Most of these systems are online or cloud based, (my preference) but it’s always good to go regularly go in and make sure the recordings are solid.  • Store video footage securely, with limited access to authorized personnel only, and establish a reten;on policy that complies with relevant laws and regula;ons.  Secure disposal of old equipment:  • Develop a clear policy and procedure for disposing of old equipment, including storage, transporta;on, and destruc;on methods. • Use cer;ﬁed and trusted companies for secure disposal and recycling of electronic waste. In most metropolitan areas, there are several recyclers that will dispose of the material either for free or a very low fee, and some will even pick it up! • Before disposal, ensure that all data is securely wiped from devices using appropriate methods, such as degaussing or physical destruc;on of hard drives. A few e-cyclers will cer;fy the data destruc;on like paper shedding companies. . Regular security audits and assessments:  • IT or MSP should be conduc;ng periodic security audits to iden;fy poten;al vulnerabili;es and areas for improvement.  Network Security - Safeguarding your agency's computer networks from unauthorized access or aTacks, including the use of ﬁrewalls, intrusion detec;on systems, and secure Wi-Fi connec;ons. Now here is where I may start to lose you, and where you may start to understand 

 8 some of the complexity.  This is the founda;on of your IT “Home”.  I’ll gloss over some of the cri;cal points.  Firewalls:  • Both hardware and sobware ﬁrewalls should be installed, ac;ng as bouncers for your agency's digital party, keeping unwanted guests out. • Firewalls should be kept in ;p-top shape by regularly upda;ng and patching their ﬁrmware and sobware, because even digital bouncers need to stay ahead of the game. • Firewalls should be conﬁgured to give a cold shoulder to unnecessary traﬃc, only lelng in the cool kids (necessary ports and services). • Keep it current and new!  The cost of a new hardware ﬁrewall pales in cost when compared to some of the other mi;ga;on op;ons.  Make sure it’s a priority and have an asset re;rement plan for it no longer than 3 years.   Wi-Fi passwords should be regularly changed and disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) – because you wouldn't leave your front door unlocked, would you? Secure your Wi-Fi with a strong password and encryp;on. Also, set up a separate Wi-Fi network for guests, so they don't access your important data.  Periodic network security assessments and vulnerability scans should be scheduled – think of them as your agency's digital check-ups, keeping things running smoothly.  Any vulnerabili;es should be quickly addressed that were found during assessments.   Con;nually upda;ng your security policies is essen;al, because procras;na;on is a hacker's best friend.  Endpoint Security - Protec;ng the devices (e.g., computers, smartphones) that connect to your network from threats like malware and unauthorized access. There are a myriad of solu;ons, some of the most poplar, (at the point of this wri;ng) and in no par;cular order are:  • CrowdStrike Falcon • Sophos Intercept X • Sen;nelOne Singularity • Microsob Defender for Endpoint  Sec1on 2.4: The Human Factor  No cybersecurity discussion would be complete without men;oning the most unpredictable element: humans. Whether it's clicking on a suspicious email link or using weak passwords, people can oben be the weakest link in your cybersecurity eﬀorts. It's essen;al to make sure 

 9 your team is educated about best prac;ces.  It is important invest in tools and policies to help minimize human error. Let’s face it, nobody wants their company's data in the hands of cybercriminals due to a momentary lapse in judgment for a too-good-to-be-true oﬀer.  So, while we can't en;rely eliminate the "oops" factor, we can certainly make an eﬀort to turn your employees into a more cyber-savvy crew, ready to dodge digital dangers and keep your business running smoothly, without any unexpected "surprises" courtesy of sneaky cyber aTackers.  It is diﬃcult to pinpoint an exact percentage of cyber aTacks related to human error, however various studies and reports highlight the signiﬁcant role that human factors play in cybersecurity incidents. Some numbers to consider include:  • According to the 2020 Verizon Data Breach Inves;ga;ons Report (DBIR), 22% of breaches involved social aTacks, which target the human element, such as phishing and pretex;ng. In addi;on, 8% of breaches were aTributed to human errors like misconﬁgura;ons and lost or misplaced assets.  • A report by Tessian found that 88% of data breaches in the U.S. in 2019 were caused by human error.  • A study by CybSafe, analyzing data from the UK Informa;on Commissioner's Oﬃce (ICO), found that 90% of cybersecurity breaches in 2019 were due to human error.  • The 2021 Proofpoint State of the Phish Report found that 57% of organiza;ons surveyed experienced a successful phishing aTack in 2020, indica;ng that human suscep;bility to such aTacks remains a signiﬁcant concern.  These ﬁgures demonstrate that the human element plays a substan;al role in cyber aTacks and emphasizes the importance of addressing this aspect when developing comprehensive cybersecurity strategies.  Just like re-shopping a client’s policy, it is vital to con;nually check on your human factor, and tune it as needed.  Here are some solu;ons to shore up one of the most vulnerable assets, your employees. Again, most if not all of these should be available from your MSP or can be outsourced by your internal IT as well.  • Regular security awareness training: Conduct frequent training sessions to educate employees about cybersecurity threats, best prac;ces, and company policies. Make sure the training content is updated regularly to cover the latest threats and trends.  

 10 • Phishing simula;ons: Run mock phishing campaigns to test your team's ability to recognize phishing emails and reinforce their skills in detec;ng and repor;ng such threats. I’ll cover this in-depth further in chapter 3.  • Real-life examples: Share real-life case studies and incidents to help employees understand the poten;al consequences of poor cybersecurity prac;ces and the importance of following guidelines. If you don’t have any, just use the stories in chapter 9!  As a bonus story, I was employed by a company that had an employee purchase $2,500 of Starbucks gib cards on what he thought were the owners’ instruc;ons.  This was done via text messaging and the scammer was impersona;ng the owner.  Fortunately the employee was intercepted before turning the cards over to the scammer…unfortunately, those cards are not refundable.  A lot of customers had Starbucks that year, and it made for great employee appreciate gibs!  • Encourage repor;ng: Foster a culture where employees feel comfortable repor;ng suspicious emails, links, or ac;vi;es without fear of blame or punishment. Establish clear repor;ng procedures and provide feedback to reinforce good behavior.  • Strong password policies: Educate employees about the importance of using strong, unique passwords and provide guidelines for crea;ng and managing them. Implement tools like password managers to help users securely store and generate complex passwords.  I know they can be annoying, but they are essen;al!  No more “Password1!” or the more secure version “Password@123!”.  Time to move on.  By implemen;ng these solu;ons, you can educate your users about the human element in cybersecurity and help them become a more proac;ve and responsible part of your organiza;on's security eﬀorts.  Now that we've covered the basics, you're well on your way to becoming a cybersecurity maestro. In the next chapter, we'll dive into the common cyber threats faced by insurance agencies and how to recognize the telltale signs of an aTack.     

 11 Chapter 3: Common Cyber Threats in the Insurance Industry  No, These Aren't Spooky Campﬁre Stories  The insurance industry faces unique cyber threats due to the nature of the data it handles and the transac;ons it processes. While I don't want to keep you up at night worrying about cyber ghouls, it's essen;al to be aware of these threats so you can take the necessary steps to protect your agency. Let's dive into some of the most common cyber threats in the insurance industry and learn how to iden;fy them.  Sec1on 3.1: Phishing  Phishing aTacks are like those pesky door-to-door salespeople, except they arrive in your inbox. These aTacks involve sending seemingly legi;mate emails designed to trick recipients into revealing sensi;ve informa;on, such as login creden;als or ﬁnancial informa;on, or to unknowingly download malware onto their devices.  Insurance agencies are prime targets for phishing aTacks because they deal with a vast amount of personal and ﬁnancial data. To protect your agency, be on the lookout for suspicious emails, educate your team on phishing red ﬂags, and use email ﬁltering and scanning tools.  Your MSP or IT staﬀ should be running regular phishing test so that you’re in a catch and release pod before you’re caught by a real angler!  There are mul;tude of sobware tools for this, and any IT Professional/Team should be doing this on an ongoing part of their service.  If not, it might be ;me to ﬁnd another hatchery!  Sec1on 3.2: Ransomware  Ransomware is the digital equivalent of a hostage situa;on. Cybercriminals use ransomware to encrypt your agency's data and hold it hostage un;l you pay a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency. These aTacks can be devasta;ng, causing down;me, ﬁnancial loss, and reputa;onal damage.  To defend against ransomware, invest in robust endpoint security, regularly back up your data, and train your employees to recognize and avoid poten;al threats.  For the damage I have had to help to undo in my tenure as an IT Professional, this has been the most impactul, and not in a good way.  I have been called in more than a few ;mes to remediate a client from a compe;tor that was not protected well enough.  According to a report by PurpleSec, there were around 304 million ransomware aTacks worldwide in 2020, a 62% increase compared to 2019. Businesses, par;cularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), were common targets due to their oben weaker cybersecurity measures.  This is the group that most Insurance Agencies fall under. 

 12  Regarding the impact of ransomware aTacks on businesses, a 2020 report by the U.S. Na;onal Cyber Security Alliance found that about 60% of small businesses went out of business within six months of a cyber aTack, including ransomware incidents. However, it's important to note that this percentage includes all types of cyber aTacks and not just ransomware aTacks.  However, ransomware it the predominate method as of this wri;ng.  Sec1on 3.3: Insider Threats  It's hard to imagine that someone on your team could be a threat to your agency, but insider threats—whether malicious or accidental—are a reality. Disgruntled employees or those with access to sensi;ve informa;on might inten;onally cause harm, while others may inadvertently create vulnerabili;es through carelessness or ignorance.  Protec;ng your agency from data theb by disgruntled employees or other internal risks in the realm of cybersecurity is a crucial responsibility and requires a proac;ve approach.  Firstly, it's essen;al to monitor and restrict access to sensi;ve data. Employees should only have access to ﬁles they need.  One of the most eﬀec;ve ways to manage this is by using Role Based Access Control (RBAC).  Whether they are a Agent, Manager, CSR, Recep;onist, etc., access can be managed at sign in.  Secondly, this is not on the IT side of things but can have just as much if not more impact. Focus on maintaining a posi;ve work environment and addressing employee grievances promptly. Disgruntled employees are more likely to engage in data theb or other malicious ac;vi;es, so fostering a culture of open communica;on and support can help mi;gate this risk. Regularly conduc;ng anonymous employee surveys can oﬀer valuable insights into poten;al issues before they escalate.  Lastly, ensure that you have a strong exit strategy in place for depar;ng employees. Immediately revoke access to all company systems, networks, and sensi;ve data upon termina;on or resigna;on. Addi;onally, conduct exit interviews to iden;fy any lingering concerns or issues that could poten;ally mo;vate a former employee to engage in data theb. Remember, preven;on is beTer than cure, especially when it comes to safeguarding your agency's digital assets.  Sec1on 3.4: Data Breaches  A data breach occurs when unauthorized individuals gain access to your agency's sensi;ve informa;on, such as client data, ﬁnancial records, or trade secrets. The consequences of a data breach can be severe, including ﬁnancial penal;es, loss of customer trust, and even business closure. 

 13 As a business owner, when it comes to preven;ng data breaches, it's important to ask the right ques;ons of your IT department or Managed Service Provider (MSP). Here are some essen;al queries to help you ensure data security while maintaining a light and approachable tone.  Encryp;on: Kindly ask your IT team or MSP , "Is our data encrypted, both at rest and in transit?" Encryp;on acts as a safeguard for your data, ensuring only authorized personnel can access its contents.  Access Controls: Inquire about your company's access controls by asking, "Do we have eﬀec;ve policies in place to restrict access to sensi;ve informa;on?" Role-based access control (RBAC) helps ensure that only those with appropriate permissions can access crucial data.  Vulnerability Assessments: Regular vulnerability assessments are essen;al for maintaining strong cybersecurity. Ask your IT or MSP , "Are we conduc;ng rou;ne check-ups to iden;fy and address poten;al security weaknesses?"  Employee Training: Your workforce is the ﬁrst line of defense against cyber threats. Ask, "Are we providing our employees with the latest training and educa;on to help them recognize and respond to cyber risks?" Regular security awareness sessions can help your employees detect phishing emails, social engineering tac;cs, and other poten;al threats.  Sec1on 3.5: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) ASacks  Imagine a swarm of bees blocking the entrance to your oﬃce. That's similar to a DDoS aTack, where cybercriminals overwhelm your agency's network or website with a ﬂood of traﬃc, making it temporarily inaccessible to your clients and employees.  While DDoS aTacks may not directly compromise your data, they can cause down;me, ﬁnancial loss, and reputa;onal damage. To protect against DDoS aTacks, invest in DDoS protec;on services and robust network security.  Now that you're familiar with the common cyber threats in the insurance industry, you're beTer equipped to defend your agency against these digital intruders. In the next chapter, we'll explore government regula;ons and compliance requirements, I’ll try not to make it any more laborious than needed.   

 14 Chapter 4: Government Regula-ons and Compliance  The Not-So-Secret Recipe for Staying on the Right Side of the Law  I know what you're thinking: "Government regula;ons and compliance? Snooze-fest!" But s;ck with us, because understanding and adhering to these requirements is crucial for protec;ng your insurance agency and your clients. In this chapter, I’ll break down the key regula;ons and compliance requirements you need to know, without pulng you to sleep.  Sec1on 4.1: GDPR - General Data Protec1on Regula1on  I’ll make this very quick as most of the target audience is in the US. If you’re only conduc;ng business in the US, you can safely skip this. However, if your insurance agency operates within the European Union (EU) or serves clients in the EU, you must comply with the GDPR. This regula;on focuses on data protec;on and privacy, giving individuals more control over their personal informa;on. GDPR compliance involves several aspects, including:  • Obtaining clear consent for data collec;on and processing • Implemen;ng data minimiza;on prac;ces • Ensuring data security and breach no;ﬁca;on protocols • Appoin;ng a Data Protec;on Oﬃcer (DPO) if required • Non-compliance with GDPR can lead to heby ﬁnes and reputa;onal damage, so it's essen;al to familiarize yourself with the regula;on and integrate its requirements into your agency's opera;ons.  Sec1on 4.2: HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  If your insurance agency deals with health insurance or handles protected health informa;on (PHI), HIPAA compliance is a must. If not, you can skip this, too! This regula;on aims to safeguard PHI and ensure the conﬁden;ality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI (ePHI). Key components of HIPAA compliance include:  • Implemen;ng administra;ve, physical, and technical safeguards • Establishing a risk management process • Conduc;ng regular risk assessments • Developing and implemen;ng policies and procedures related to ePHI • Viola;ng HIPAA can result in substan;al ﬁnes and even criminal charges, so be sure to priori;ze compliance eﬀorts.  Now this is not a book on complying with HIPPA, because that ;believe it or not, is more involved than network security in my opinion.  Naviga;ng HIPAA compliance may seem daun;ng, but I have some basic ;ps to help you start the process with ease.  

 15  Appoint a HIPAA Expert, Designate a Privacy Oﬃcer and a Security Oﬃcer.  This can be just one person if your organiza;on isn’t too large. These individuals will be responsible for developing and implemen;ng your agency's HIPAA policies and procedures. They'll be your guides through the complex world of health informa;on privacy.  This important because a large amount of HIPPA requires Policies and Prac;ces that require a bit of ATorney ;me. A necessary expense that works a lot like, well, an insurance policy!  Provide regular training sessions for your employees to ensure they're well-versed in handling protected health informa;on (PHI) securely and responsibly. Keep the sessions engaging and interac;ve to reinforce the importance of HIPAA compliance in their daily tasks. This can be done by an outside third party, and I highly encourage you to seek them out. They will also guide you to compliance.   Sec1on 4.3: State-Speciﬁc Data Breach No1ﬁca1on Laws  In the US, each state has its own data breach no;ﬁca;on laws, requiring businesses to no;fy aﬀected individuals and, in some cases, regulators when a data breach occurs. While the speciﬁcs vary from state to state, some common requirements include:  Prompt no;ﬁca;on of aﬀected individuals, oben within a speciﬁed ;meframe Repor;ng to state regulators, depending on the size of the breach Oﬀering credit monitoring or iden;ty theb protec;on services to aﬀected individuals Familiarize yourself with the data breach no;ﬁca;on laws in the states where your agency operates and create a breach response plan to ensure ;mely and appropriate ac;on in case of an incident.  My advice on this would be to join an organiza;on such as the PIA (Professional Insurance Agents), or the Big I chapter in your State.  There are other organiza;ons as well, however I am very familiar with both of those.  They are the “Oracles of Regula;ons” for all things P&C.  Also, by joining these organiza;ons, they also lobby for independent agents, so you’d be suppor;ng an organiza;on that will also support the industry!  Sec1on 4.4: Industry-Speciﬁc Regula1ons  Depending on the types of insurance products your agency oﬀers, you may be subject to addi;onal industry-speciﬁc regula;ons. For example, agencies dealing with ﬁnancial products may need to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which includes privacy and security requirements for ﬁnancial ins;tu;ons.  To ﬁnd resources and informa;on on industry-speciﬁc regula;ons like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and other applicable laws, consider the following:  

 16 • Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Website: The FTC is the primary regulator of GLBA and provides comprehensive resources on their website. Visit the FTC's GLBA page (hTps://www.bc.gov/;ps-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act) for guidance on compliance, including privacy and security requirements for ﬁnancial ins;tu;ons. • Na;onal Associa;on of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Website: The NAIC is an excellent resource for insurance agencies, as it provides valuable informa;on on various regula;ons applicable to the industry. Visit the NAIC's website (hTps://www.naic.org/) for resources, updates, and insights on industry-speciﬁc regula;ons. • Industry Associa;ons: Join industry associa;ons that focus on your speciﬁc insurance products. These organiza;ons oben provide resources, updates, and guidance on compliance with relevant regula;ons. Examples of such associa;ons include the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America (hTps://www.independentagent.com/) and the Na;onal Associa;on of Professional Insurance Agents (hTps://www.pianet.com/). • Legal Databases: U;lize legal research databases, such as LexisNexis or Westlaw, to access informa;on on industry-speciﬁc regula;ons. These databases contain up-to-date legal informa;on and can provide in-depth insights into applicable laws. • Consult Legal Counsel: Engage with an aTorney or legal counsel who specializes in your speciﬁc industry. Their exper;se will help you understand and navigate the complexi;es of industry-speciﬁc regula;ons, ensuring your agency remains compliant. • By u;lizing these resources, your insurance agency can stay informed and compliant with industry-speciﬁc regula;ons, eﬀec;vely minimizing risks and maintaining a strong reputa;on for protec;ng sensi;ve informa;on.  Make sure to research and adhere to any industry-speciﬁc regula;ons that apply to your agency's opera;ons.  Sec1on 4.5:  Understanding the New York State) Cybersecurity Regula1on  The NYDFS Cybersecurity Regula;on, oﬃcially known as 23 NYCRR Part 500, is a set of rules aimed at ﬁnancial service companies, including insurance agencies, opera;ng within New York State. Implemented in 2017, these regula;ons were designed to protect consumers and the ﬁnancial industry by ensuring that organiza;ons have robust cybersecurity programs in place.  Key Components of the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regula;on The regula;on contains a series of requirements that insurance agencies must follow to remain compliant. Some of the key components include: • Designa;ng a Chief Informa;on Security Oﬃcer (CISO) to oversee and enforce cybersecurity policies. • Implemen;ng a comprehensive cybersecurity program and wriTen policy. • Conduc;ng regular risk assessments and ensuring ;mely remedia;on of iden;ﬁed vulnerabili;es. 

 17 • Establishing a robust access control system, including mul;-factor authen;ca;on. • Encryp;ng sensi;ve data, both at rest and in transit. • Regularly training employees on cybersecurity awareness. • Developing a comprehensive incident response plan.  While the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regula;on can be overwhelming, it's crucial to view it as an opportunity to strengthen your agency's cybersecurity posture. By embracing the change and inves;ng in a robust cybersecurity program, you'll be beTer equipped to protect your clients' sensi;ve data and safeguard your agency's future.  Sec1on 4.5: Staying Compliant  Ensuring compliance when working with an MSP or relying on an internal IT team is crucial for insurance agencies. Here are some sugges;ons to help your agency stay compliant with technology, regardless of your IT support model:  • Establish Clear Policies: Develop well-deﬁned policies and procedures that cover compliance requirements, data privacy, and security. These policies should be clearly communicated to your MSP or internal IT team, as well as all employees within the agency.  • Due Diligence: If working with an MSP , conduct thorough due diligence to ensure they have experience with insurance agencies, a strong compliance track record, and a solid understanding of industry-speciﬁc regula;ons. For an internal IT team, make sure they are trained and knowledgeable in relevant compliance requirements.  • Compliance Responsibili;es: Clearly outline compliance expecta;ons and responsibili;es in your contract with the MSP or in your internal IT team's guidelines. This will help ensure that all par;es understand their roles in maintaining compliance.  • Regular Communica;on: Maintain open lines of communica;on with your MSP or internal IT team. Schedule periodic mee;ngs to discuss compliance-related updates, concerns, or changes in regula;ons. This ongoing dialogue will help ensure that everyone stays informed and proac;ve in addressing compliance issues.  • Training and Educa;on: Provide regular training and educa;onal resources for both your employees and your IT support (MSP or internal IT team) to ensure they're up-to-date on compliance requirements and industry-speciﬁc regula;ons.  • Compliance Audits: Conduct regular compliance audits or assessments, regardless of whether you're working with an MSP or an internal IT team. This will help you iden;fy poten;al areas of concern and address them before they escalate into signiﬁcant issues. 

 18 • Incident Response Plan: Collaborate with your IT support (MSP or internal IT team) to develop a comprehensive incident response plan for poten;al security breaches or compliance issues. This plan should outline the roles and responsibili;es of each party and provide clear guidance on how to respond to and resolve incidents.  By taking these proac;ve steps, your insurance agency can eﬀec;vely maintain compliance while leveraging the exper;se and resources of your chosen IT support model.  In the next chapter, we'll dive into best prac;ces for cybersecurity in insurance agencies, complete with prac;cal ;ps and strategies to help you level up your security game.   

 19 Chapter 5: Best Prac-ces for Cybersecurity in Insurance Agencies  Your Cybersecurity Toolbox: Tried and True Strategies  Now that you're well-versed in common cyber threats and government regula;ons, it's ;me to put that knowledge to work. In this chapter, we'll explore the best prac;ces for cybersecurity in insurance agencies, providing you with prac;cal ;ps and strategies to bolster your agency's digital defenses.  Sec1on 5.1: Employee Training and Awareness  I’ve already gone over the human factor, but I feel this should also be listed again. Your employees can be your greatest asset or your biggest vulnerability when it comes to cybersecurity. Implement regular cybersecurity training and awareness programs to keep your team informed about the latest threats and best prac;ces. Topics to cover include:  • Phishing and social engineering aTacks • Password hygiene and mul;-factor authen;ca;on (MFA).  Also consider a password manager. • Safe internet browsing and email prac;ces • Incident repor;ng and response procedures  Sec1on 5.2: Robust Access Controls  Make sure your IT or MSP has implemented strong access controls, this is crucial for protec;ng your agency's sensi;ve informa;on. To achieve this, follow the principle of least privilege by gran;ng employees access only to the data and systems they need to perform their jobs. Addi;onally, use MFA to add an extra layer of security to user accounts.  Implemen;ng strong access controls is essen;al to protect your agency's sensi;ve informa;on. Here are some sugges;ons to achieve this eﬀec;vely:  Principle of Least Privilege (POLP): Adhere to the POLP by gran;ng employees access only to the data and systems necessary for their job func;ons. These should be regularly reviewed and updated for access permissions to ensure they align with each employee's current role and responsibili;es.  Mul;-Factor Authen;ca;on (MFA): Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security to user accounts. This requires users to provide at least two forms of iden;ﬁca;on (e.g., a password and a one-;me code) before gran;ng access to systems or data. If you do not have MFA, you need to put this in place yesterday!  If not in all 50 states as a law, I assure you that at least one of your carriers will mandate it.  Also, it’s just the right thing to do for yourself and your clients.  You wouldn’t patron a bank if they didn’t have a second authen;ca;on like your phone to access your money, this is no diﬀerent.  

 20   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC is used to deﬁne and manage user access based on their roles within the organiza;on. This approach simpliﬁes access management and helps maintain consistency in gran;ng permissions.  Regular Audi;ng: User accounts and access privileges should be periodically audited to ensure they remain appropriate and up-to-date. Promptly revoke access for employees who no longer require it or have leb the organiza;on.  Secure Password Prac;ces: Your IT or MSP should mandate the use of strong, unique passwords for all user accounts. Implement password policies that require regular password updates and discourage password reuse across mul;ple platorms.  Employee Training: Provide regular training sessions for employees, emphasizing the importance of access control, secure password prac;ces, and repor;ng suspicious ac;vity. Educate them on the poten;al risks associated with unauthorized access and the consequences of non-compliance.  Sec-on 5.3: Regular Security Audits and Assessments  Schedule regular security audits and risk assessments to iden;fy and address poten;al vulnerabili;es in your agency's IT infrastructure. This process can help you:  Detect unauthorized access or unusual ac;vity Iden;fy outdated sobware and hardware Evaluate the eﬀec;veness of your current security measures  Sec-on 5.4: Data Encryp-on/Email Encryp-on  Encrypt sensi;ve data both at rest (stored on devices) and in transit (sent over networks) to protect it from unauthorized access. Consider using tools such as email encryp;on, VPNs for remote workers, and full-disk encryp;on for company devices. Rather than dive deep into this endless explana;on, please converse with your IT provider and make sure this is in place.  On the other hand I will delve into this; email encryp;on. It is  vital for insurance agencies for several reasons, and understanding the associated regula;ons is crucial for protec;ng privileged data.  By default, EVERY email should be encrypted.  The regula;ons can be as small as two iden;fying pieces of informa;on to qualify it as mandatory.  This can be an email address and full name, a policy number and email address, a phone number and a name, etc. By default assure that it is implemented this way.  There are several services that require liTle to no interac;on for a recipient to receive the email.  Other reason for encryp;on: 

 21 • Protect Sensi;ve Informa;on: Insurance agencies handle a signiﬁcant amount of sensi;ve informa;on, including clients' personal, ﬁnancial, and health data. Email encryp;on ensures that this data remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized par;es during transmission. • Compliance with Regula;ons: Insurance agencies are subject to various data privacy and security regula;ons, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and state-speciﬁc data privacy laws. Email encryp;on helps agencies comply with these regula;ons by safeguarding sensi;ve data and preven;ng unauthorized access. • HIPAA: Agencies dealing with health insurance must comply with HIPAA's Privacy and Security Rules, which require the protec;on of electronic protected health informa;on (ePHI). Email encryp;on helps meet this requirement by securing ePHI transmiTed via email. • GLBA: Insurance agencies oﬀering ﬁnancial products must adhere to GLBA's privacy and security provisions. This act mandates ﬁnancial ins;tu;ons to protect customers' non-public personal informa;on (NPI), which includes data transmiTed via email. Email encryp;on helps agencies maintain compliance with GLBA by safeguarding NPI. • Maintain Client Trust: Encryp;ng email communica;on demonstrates to clients that the agency takes data privacy and security seriously, helping build and maintain trust. • Minimize Risk of Data Breaches: Email encryp;on reduces the risk of data breaches caused by unauthorized access to sensi;ve informa;on transmiTed via email. This, in turn, helps insurance agencies avoid poten;al ﬁnancial and reputa;onal damage. • Safeguard Against Human Error: Email encryp;on provides an added layer of protec;on against accidental data leaks caused by human error, such as sending an email to the wrong recipient or inadvertently including sensi;ve informa;on in an email. • In summary, email encryp;on is vital for insurance agencies as it helps protect sensi;ve informa;on, comply with data privacy and security regula;ons, maintain client trust, minimize the risk of data breaches, and safeguard against human error.  Sec;on 5.5: Backup and Disaster Recovery  Create a comprehensive backup and disaster recovery plan to ensure your agency can quickly recover from a cyber aTack or other catastrophic event. The ques;ons that you should ask from you MSP/IT are extensive.  I was in Scouts growing up, and being prepared has served me well without fail!  Here are some ques;ons you should ask about you backup and DR solu;ons, including cloud and on-premises systems:  • What is our current backup and DR strategy? Can you provide an overview of our exis;ng solu;ons, including hardware, sobware, and the processes involved? • How frequently are our backups performed, and is this schedule suﬃcient for our business requirements? 

 22 • What types of data are included in the backup and DR process (e.g., client informa;on, ﬁnancial records, emails, etc.)? Are there any data types that are not currently covered? • How are backups tested and veriﬁed to ensure data integrity and reliability? How oben are these tests performed? • What is the process for restoring data from a backup and implemen;ng the DR plan? How long does it typically take to restore data and resume normal opera;ons in the event of a disaster? • Can you provide a comparison of on-premises and cloud backup and DR solu;ons? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? • What security measures are in place to protect our backups and DR infrastructure from unauthorized access or cyber threats? • If we use a cloud-based backup and DR solu;on, where is the data physically stored? What are the data center's security cer;ﬁca;ons, and do they meet our compliance requirements? • How does our DR solu;on ensure minimal down;me and rapid recovery in the event of a disaster or hardware failure? • How is our backup and DR solu;on scalable to accommodate our agency's growth? Are there any limita;ons we should be aware of? • What is the total cost of ownership for our backup and DR solu;on, including hardware, sobware, and maintenance fees? Is there a cost diﬀerence between cloud and on-premises solu;ons? • How long are backups retained, and what is the process for data archiving? Can we customize the reten;on period based on our speciﬁc needs? • What level of support is available from our IT department or MSP in the event of a backup or DR-related issue? Are there any addi;onal services or features we should consider for our backup and DR solu;on? • By asking these ques;ons, you can gain a beTer understanding of your current backup and DR solu;ons, evaluate the beneﬁts and drawbacks of both on-premises and cloud systems, and ensure that your business data remains secure and accessible in the event of a disaster or data loss.   

 23 Chapter 6: Policies and Procedures  Don't Just React, Get Proac;ve!  Taking a reac;ve approach to cybersecurity can leave your insurance agency scrambling to respond to threats as they occur, which can be both costly and damaging. Instead, shib your focus to developing a proac;ve cybersecurity strategy, which can help you an;cipate and prevent cyber aTacks before they wreak havoc. In this chapter, I’ll guide you through the process of crea;ng a proac;ve cybersecurity strategy for your insurance agency.  Sec-on 6.1: Deﬁning Policies and Roles  The need for agency owners to have policies and procedures in place for their business when considering cybersecurity is crucial for several reasons. These policies and procedures act as a founda;on for maintaining a strong security posture, protec;ng sensi;ve informa;on, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Policies will require coopera;on from several sources, Legal, HR, Opera;ons, and IT.  I’m sure I’m missing a few, but you get the picture.  This is a big undertaking but a crucial part of insuring a solid founda;on.  Each will need to be customized, but here are a few that should apply to all:  Compile a list of all exis;ng security policies and procedures. • Verify that each policy is up to date and has been reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders. • Ensure policies cover all necessary areas, such as access control, data protec;on, incident response, and network security. Roles and Responsibili;es: • Deﬁne roles and responsibili;es for employees, management, and IT personnel regarding security. • Ensure that responsibili;es are clearly communicated and understood by all relevant par;es. Vendor Management: • Review policies for assessing the security posture of third-party vendors and partners. • Evaluate the process for monitoring and managing vendor access to your organiza;on's data and systems. • Assess contractual agreements and requirements for vendors to maintain appropriate security controls. Compliance and Audi;ng: • Review policies and procedures for maintaining compliance with applicable laws, regula;ons, and industry standards. • Assess the process for conduc;ng internal and external security audits. • Evaluate the eﬀec;veness of your organiza;on's risk assessment and mi;ga;on processes. 

 24  Sec1on 6.2: Procedures  Procedures play a cri;cal role in your agency's cybersecurity framework, ensuring that the organiza;on consistently implements and maintains the best prac;ces necessary to protect sensi;ve data and systems. Here are several reasons why procedures should be a priority for insurance agency owners when it comes to cybersecurity:  Standardiza;on and Consistency:  • Procedures provide clear, step-by-step guidelines for employees to follow when performing speciﬁc tasks related to cybersecurity. This standardiza;on ensures that security measures are consistently applied across the organiza;on, reducing the likelihood of errors or oversights that could lead to vulnerabili;es or data breaches. Aber all, nobody wants to be "that guy" who leaves the virtual door unlocked for cybercriminals!  Employee Accountability:  • By outlining speciﬁc procedures, insurance agency owners can clearly deﬁne the roles and responsibili;es of employees in maintaining the organiza;on's cybersecurity posture. This clarity promotes accountability and helps employees understand their part in protec;ng the agency's sensi;ve informa;on and systems. Remember, in the realm of cybersecurity, teamwork makes the dream work!  Incident Response:  • A well-deﬁned set of procedures for incident response ensures that the insurance agency is prepared to act quickly and eﬀec;vely in the event of a cyber incident. These procedures can help minimize the poten;al damage caused by a breach or aTack, reducing the impact on clients, the agency's reputa;on, and its ﬁnancial stability.   Compliance and Audi;ng:  • Regulatory bodies oben require insurance agencies to follow speciﬁc procedures to demonstrate compliance with data protec;on and privacy laws. By having these procedures in place, agency owners can streamline the compliance and audi;ng process, ensuring that they meet regulatory requirements and avoid poten;al penal;es. It's always beTer to be on the right side of the law, especially when it comes to cybersecurity!  Training and Awareness:  • Clearly documented procedures can serve as valuable training materials for employees, ensuring that they are aware of the organiza;on's security protocols and best prac;ces. Regular training based on these procedures can help reinforce 

 25 cybersecurity awareness and create a security-conscious culture within the agency.   Con;nual Improvement:  • Procedures provide a framework for insurance agency owners to measure the eﬀec;veness of their cybersecurity eﬀorts and iden;fy areas for improvement. By regularly reviewing and upda;ng procedures, agency owners can stay ahead of emerging threats and adapt their security prac;ces as needed, ensuring ongoing protec;on for their clients' data and their business opera;ons.   Knowledge Transfer:  • Well-documented procedures facilitate the transfer of knowledge within the organiza;on, par;cularly when onboarding new employees or transi;oning between IT personnel. This knowledge transfer helps maintain the agency's cybersecurity posture and ensures that new team members can quickly become familiar with the organiza;on's security prac;ces. Aber all, there's no "I" in cybersecurity team! Before I ended up in the IT world, I managed the McDonalds in Leavenworth, WA, (not the peniten;ary!).  One lesson I took with me is that doing something consistently and making it repeatable removed a myriad of roadblocks. It allowed for consistent results from the small Bavarian town in Washington State to Moscow Russia…and it was all the same.  And I can verify this ﬁrsthand.  It impressed on me that a world away in a diﬀerent country I could expect the same.   Procedures allow for the same repeatable results, otherwise it is a very inconsistent experience for every client.  In the next chapter we’ll go over what happens when the ounce of preven;on may not be the complete cure.   

 26  Chapter 7: Incident Response and Remedia-on  When Cyber Storms Hit: Weathering the Abermath  In a perfect world, your insurance agency would never experience a cyber aTack. But in reality, even the most prepared organiza;ons can fall vic;m to incidents. In this chapter, I’ll discuss the importance of having an incident response and remedia;on plan in place, and provide you with prac;cal ;ps for managing the abermath of a cyber aTack.  Sec1on 7.1: The Importance of an Incident Response Plan  An incident response plan is your agency's roadmap for naviga;ng a cyber aTack or security breach. Having a well-deﬁned plan in place can help you:  Minimizing Damage and Down-me:  To minimize the damage and down;me caused by an incident, the following should be implemented.   • Quick Detec;on: Set up systems that will quickly spot any cyber incidents, so your IT team or MSP can act fast to handle the problem. This helps to limit the damage and disrup;on to your business.  • Containment: Create a plan with your IT team or MSP to isolate aﬀected computers and networks when an incident occurs. This prevents the problem from spreading and causing more harm to your agency.  • Recovery: Make sure your agency has a backup plan to restore important systems and data aber an incident. Your IT team or MSP should regularly test these backups to ensure they work when needed. This will help your agency get back to normal opera;ons as quickly as possible.  • Communica;on: Develop a clear way to communicate with your employees, customers, and partners during a cyber incident. Keep everyone informed about what's happening and how it's being addressed. This can help maintain trust and minimize any confusion or misunderstandings.   Maintaining Customer Trust:  To maintain customer trust during a cyber incident, consider the following:  

 27 • Be Open and Transparent: Communicate honestly about the incident, the ac;ons you're taking to address it, and any poten;al impact on your customers. Clear and truthful communica;on helps avoid the spread of misinforma;on and maintains trust between your agency and your customers.  • Provide Timely Updates: Oﬀer regular updates on the situa;on and the progress made towards resolving the issue. This demonstrates your dedica;on to handling the problem and helps maintain customer conﬁdence in your agency.  • Oﬀer Support: Extend assistance to customers aﬀected by the incident, such as providing guidance on iden;ty theb protec;on or credit monitoring services, if appropriate. By oﬀering support, you can alleviate customer concerns and show that your agency is commiTed to helping them navigate any diﬃcul;es resul;ng from the incident.  The best way to earn customer trust it to be transparent and relaying your response to the incident to them. Keeping it concealed will only foster distrust further. You should always discuss with legal council on what you are able to share.  Ensuring Compliance with Regulatory Requirements:  To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for incident repor;ng there are a few steps.  Familiarize yourself with the repor;ng requirements speciﬁc to your industry and jurisdic;on. This may include deadlines for no;fying authori;es, customers, or other stakeholders. Here are a few resources for local and federal regula;ons.   • Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): hTps://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/  • Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal: hTps://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf  • State-level data breach no;ﬁca;on laws: hTps://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunica;ons-and-informa;on-technology/security-breach-no;ﬁca;on-laws.aspx   Documen;ng the incident and your agency's response is crucial for maintaining compliance, analyzing the situa;on, and learning from the experience. Here are some resources and ;ps for documen;ng a cyber incident eﬀec;vely:  • NIST Special Publica;on 800-61 Revision 2: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide: hTps://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublica;ons/NIST.SP .800-61r2.pdf 

 28 This guide provides best prac;ces for incident response, including documen;ng and repor;ng incidents.  • SANS Incident Handler's Handbook: hTps://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/incident/incident-handlers-handbook-33901. This handbook provides an overview of the incident handling process, including guidelines for documenta;on.  When documen;ng an incident, you should collect informa;on such as:  • Date and ;me of the incident discovery • Descrip;on of the incident (e.g., type of aTack, systems aﬀected, data compromised) • Chronology of events (a ;meline detailing how the incident unfolded and was detected) • Incident response team members and their roles • Ac;ons taken to contain and resolve the incident • Details of any external support, such as law enforcement or third-party security experts • Impact assessment, including ﬁnancial losses, opera;onal disrup;on, and damage to your agency's reputa;on • Lessons learned from the incident, such as vulnerabili;es iden;ﬁed, and improvements needed in processes, policies, or infrastructure • Steps taken or planned to prevent similar incidents in the future, including changes to policies, procedures, employee training, and security measures  Keeping detailed records of the incident and your agency's response will not only help you comply with regulatory requirements but also enable your organiza;on to learn from the experience and improve its overall security posture.  No;fy the appropriate regulatory bodies and stakeholders as required, adhering to the established guidelines and ;meframes.  Learning and Improvement:  To learn from a cyber incident and strengthen your agency's security, consider these steps:  • Analyze the Incident: Aber an incident, work with your IT provider to conduct a thorough review of what happened. This will help you understand the root cause of the breach and iden;fy any shortcomings in your current cybersecurity measures. This analysis will provide valuable insights to prevent similar incidents in the future.  • Evaluate Your Incident Response Plan: Assess how well your incident response plan worked during the actual event. Collaborate with your IT provider to iden;fy any areas that need improvement, such as communica;on, detec;on, containment, or 

 29 recovery. Update your plan accordingly to ensure it remains eﬀec;ve in managing future cyber threats.  • Strengthen Your Cybersecurity Measures: Based on the ﬁndings from the incident analysis and response plan evalua;on, implement necessary changes to enhance your agency's cybersecurity. This may include:  • Upda;ng policies and procedures: Collaborate with your IT provider to revise and enhance your agency's cybersecurity policies and procedures. This can help ensure that your agency is beTer prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to future cyber incidents.  • Improving employee training: Provide addi;onal training for your employees on cybersecurity best prac;ces, such as recognizing phishing emails, using strong passwords, and adhering to your agency's security policies. These can oben be oﬀered as   • Adop;ng new technologies: Work with your IT provider to iden;fy and deploy new security technologies that can help protect your agency from emerging threats. This may include advanced threat detec;on tools, encryp;on solu;ons, or mul;-factor authen;ca;on systems.  This is a constantly evolving process.  Learning from what happened is the only way we can beTer prepare.  There is no solu;on that is 100% eﬀec;ve, but shoring up will have you beTer equipped in the future.    Sec1on 7.2: Key Elements of an Incident Response Plan  A comprehensive incident response plan should include the following elements:  Roles and Responsibili-es: Clearly deﬁne the roles and responsibili;es of your incident response team members, ensuring that everyone knows their part in tackling a cyber incident. Think of it as a well-coordinated sports team, where each player has a speciﬁc posi;on and purpose. In cases where your agency works with a MSP , these roles may be shared or coordinated with the MSP and legal. Key roles in an incident response team typically include:  • Incident Manager: This person oversees the en;re response process, making crucial decisions, coordina;ng team eﬀorts, and ensuring that the plan is executed eﬃciently. They also act as the primary point of contact between your agency and the MSP during the incident.  • Communica;on Lead: The communica;on lead is responsible for sharing informa;on about the incident both internally (within the agency) and externally (with customers, 

 30 partners, and regulators). They manage public rela;ons, crab necessary announcements, and keep all stakeholders informed.  • Technical Lead: This role can be ﬁlled by an IT expert from your agency or the MSP , depending on the agreement. The technical lead takes charge of inves;ga;ng the incident, iden;fying the root cause, and recommending appropriate technical solu;ons to contain and remediate the threat.  • IT Support Staﬀ: These team members, which could include both your in-house IT staﬀ and the MSP personnel, assist the technical lead by implemen;ng the suggested technical solu;ons, such as isola;ng aﬀected systems, recovering data, and applying patches or updates.  • Legal and Compliance Lead: This individual ensures that your agency follows all applicable laws and regula;ons related to the incident, such as repor;ng requirements and customer no;ﬁca;ons.  By establishing and communica;ng these roles and responsibili;es within your incident response plan, you’ll have a united front and a solid direc;on. Pulng this into place will greatly reduce down;me and damage.  Detec-on and Analysis: Outline the procedures and tools your agency, in collabora;on with your MSP and/or IT Staﬀ, will u;lize to iden;fy and examine poten;al incidents. This may include tools like intrusion detec;on systems and strategies such as log monitoring, along with incident repor;ng channels. Key aspects to consider are:  • Intrusion Detec;on Systems: An intrusion detec;on system (IDS)  should be implemented that can monitor your network and systems for signs of unauthorized access, malware, or other poten;al threats. An IDS will alert your team and the MSP when suspicious ac;vity is detected, allowing for a swib response.  • Log Monitoring: Collaborate with your IT provider to establish a process for regularly monitoring and analyzing system and applica;on logs. These logs can provide valuable insights into unusual ac;vity or unauthorized access aTempts, helping you iden;fy poten;al incidents before they escalate.  • Incident Repor;ng Channels: Create clear channels for employees, customers, and other stakeholders to report suspected security incidents. This may include a dedicated email address, phone number, or an online repor;ng form. Ensure that your IT is also informed of these repor;ng channels, so they can quickly become involved in the response process when necessary.  Containment and Eradica-on: Describe the measures your team, in coopera;on with your IT provider, will undertake to control the incident and eliminate the threat. This may involve 

 31 ac;ons like isola;ng aﬀected systems, eradica;ng malware, and introducing supplementary security safeguards. Key components to consider are:  • Isola;ng Aﬀected Systems: Work with your IT provider to develop procedures for promptly isola;ng compromised systems and networks. This helps prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage. Measures might include disconnec;ng aﬀected devices from the network or limi;ng their access to other systems.  • Removing Malware: This will  to establish a process for detec;ng and elimina;ng any malware or unauthorized access tools present on aﬀected systems. This can involve using an;virus sobware, specialized malware removal tools, or manual removal methods to ensure that the threat is en;rely eradicated.  • Implemen;ng Addi;onal Security Measures: Aber containing and eradica;ng the threat, work with your IT provider to evaluate your exis;ng security measures and iden;fy any necessary improvements. This may include patching vulnerabili;es, strengthening access controls, or deploying addi;onal security tools to prevent similar incidents in the future. • Recovery and Restora;on: Outline how your agency will restore aﬀected systems and services, including data recovery procedures and system tes;ng to ensure a return to normal opera;ons.  No-ﬁca-on and Repor-ng: Develop procedures for no;fying aﬀected par;es, such as customers, employees, and external partners, as well as regulatory bodies when a cyber incident occurs. These no;ﬁca;ons must comply with applicable laws and industry standards. Work with your IT provider to understand the repor;ng requirements speciﬁc to your industry and jurisdic;on, and ensure that your agency can meet any deadlines for no;fying authori;es and stakeholders. Establish clear communica;on channels and protocols to keep everyone informed about the incident and the ac;ons being taken to resolve it.  Post-Incident Review: Create a structured process for conduc;ng a post-incident review aber the resolu;on of a cyber incident. This review should involve an in-depth analysis of the incident, including iden;fying the root cause, assessing the eﬀec;veness of your response, and evalua;ng any weaknesses in your exis;ng cybersecurity controls. Collaborate with your IT provider during the review process to gather their insights and exper;se. Use the lessons learned from the review to make improvements to your cybersecurity measures, such as upda;ng policies, procedures, and technologies to prevent similar incidents in the future. Regularly upda;ng your incident response plan based on these ﬁndings will ensure that your agency remains prepared and resilient against evolving cyber threats.   Sec1on 7.3: Incident Remedia1on Strategies  

 32 Aber responding to and containing a cyber incident, it's essen;al to turn your aTen;on towards remedia;on. Collabora;ng with your IT provider, you'll need to evaluate and implement strategies to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Remedia;on strategies will vary based on the nature of the aTack but may include:  • Patching Vulnerabili;es and Upda;ng Sobware: Work with your IT provider to iden;fy and patch any vulnerabili;es exploited during the incident. Ensure that your systems and sobware are up to date with the latest security patches to minimize the risk of future aTacks.  • Implemen;ng Addi;onal Security Controls: Evaluate your exis;ng security measures and consider implemen;ng addi;onal controls to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. This may involve strengthening access controls, deploying advanced threat detec;on tools, or enhancing network security.  • Revising Policies and Procedures: Based on the lessons learned from the incident, revise your agency's cybersecurity policies and procedures to address iden;ﬁed weaknesses. Collaborate with your IT provider to develop more robust guidelines that help safeguard your systems and data.  • Providing Addi;onal Training and Awareness for Employees: Enhance employee awareness of cybersecurity threats and best prac;ces through addi;onal training sessions.

Honest communica;on can help prevent the spread of misinforma;on and maintain trust between your agency, customers, and partners. 

 33 • Timely Updates: Provide regular updates on the incident's status and the progress being made toward resolu;on. Demonstra;ng your commitment to addressing the issue helps maintain customer conﬁdence and reassures stakeholders that you are ac;vely working to protect their interests.  • Regulatory Requirements: Familiarize yourself with the repor;ng requirements speciﬁc to your industry and jurisdic;on. Adhere to any deadlines for no;fying authori;es, customers, or other stakeholders. Your IT provider can oﬀer guidance on these regula;ons, and you should consider seeking legal counsel to ensure your communica;ons comply with applicable laws.  Honesty, when permiTed by legal considera;ons, is always the best policy. Stakeholders are more likely to support and engage with a team that is commiTed to making a diﬀerence and taking the appropriate steps for remedia;on. CyberaTacks will inevitably aﬀect many businesses; however, those that are well-prepared and respond appropriately are more likely to withstand these events.  

 34 Chapter 8: Educa-ng Your Team and Customers  Knowledge is Power: Strengthening Your Cybersecurity Through Educa;on  A strong cybersecurity posture extends beyond your agency's IT infrastructure—it requires the ac;ve involvement of your en;re team and, in some cases, your customers. In this chapter, we'll explore the importance of educa;ng your team and customers on cybersecurity best prac;ces, providing you with ;ps and strategies for crea;ng a culture of security awareness.  Sec1on 8.1: Employee Training and Awareness Programs  As I men;oned earlier, your employees can be your greatest asset or your biggest vulnerability when it comes to cybersecurity. Regular training and awareness programs can help ensure that your team is well-versed in the latest threats and best prac;ces. Key topics to cover in your training programs include:  • Recognizing Cybersecurity Risks: Begin by iden;fying the various risks that could impact your agency's informa;on systems and data. This includes both internal and external threats, such as unauthorized access, malware, phishing aTacks, insider threats, and natural disasters. Work with your IT provider to gain a comprehensive understanding of the poten;al risks and how they might aﬀect your opera;ons.  • Assessing the Impact: Once you've recognized the poten;al risks, assess the impact each could have on your agency. Consider factors such as the sensi;vity of the data at risk, the poten;al ﬁnancial costs of a breach, and the reputa;onal damage that could result from an incident. Engage your IT provider in this assessment process to gather their insights and exper;se on poten;al impacts and mi;ga;on strategies.  • Priori;zing Risks: Based on the assessed impact, priori;ze the risks to determine which ones require the most immediate aTen;on and resources. Collaborate with your IT provider to develop a risk management plan that addresses the most signiﬁcant threats ﬁrst, while also considering the cost and feasibility of implemen;ng various security measures.  Sec1on 8.2: Crea1ng a Security-Conscious Culture  Developing a security-conscious culture within your agency can help ensure that cybersecurity remains a top priority for everyone on your team. To foster this culture, consider the following strategies:  • Lead by example, demonstra;ng a commitment to security at the management level • Encourage open communica;on and feedback regarding security concerns • Recognize and reward employees who demonstrate excep;onal security prac;ces • Incorporate security awareness into onboarding processes for new hires

Consider oﬀering resources and guidance on topics such as:  • Iden;fying and avoiding phishing aTacks • Protec;ng personal informa;on online • Recognizing the signs of iden;ty theb • Using secure methods for communica;ng with your agency • You can share this informa;on through various channels, such as your website, social media, email newsleTers, and printed materials.  Addi;onally, trea;ng your clients and prospects to lunch and learning can be a great strategy. Not only will it equip them with valuable knowledge, but it may also land you some sweet deals. Plus, in the event of an incident, they'll be more likely to trust you (and not just because they're in a food coma). And let's be real, who doesn't love a free lunch? MSPs will be jumping at the chance to host an event like this - it's one of the most requested speaking engagements I receive (probably because it's one of the few ;mes people actually want to listen to them). These events have always been fruitul for agencies, so go ahead and wine and dine your clients, and who knows? You might just seal the deal over a plate of delicious sandwiches. 

 36 Chapter 9: Case Studies: Learning from Real-World Examples  Lessons from the Front Lines: Cybersecurity Tales to Heed  Sec-on 9.1: A Cau-onary Tale - The Ransomware A^ack That Shook an Insurance Agency  Once upon a ;me, in a not-so-distant past, there was an insurance agency that thought it had everything under control. The company enjoyed a solid reputa;on, a loyal client base, and a seemingly reliable internal IT department. LiTle did they know that their outdated technology and lack of proper investment in cybersecurity measures would soon bring their world crashing down.  Sec-on 9.2: The Ransomware Nightmare Unfolds  One fateful day, the agency fell vic;m to a devasta;ng ransomware aTack. Their en;re system was compromised—computers, servers, and even network switches. The aTackers demanded a heby sum in exchange for the decryp;on keys, and the company found itself in an impossible situa;on.  Desperate for help, the agency's owner sought the exper;se of our trusty author to consult on the maTer and remediate the damage. Upon inves;ga;on, it was evident that the internal IT department had not received the necessary funding to implement cri;cal security measures.  To make maTers worse, the ransomware aTack occurred during the height of the Russian-Ukrainian conﬂict. The group responsible for the aTack was designated as a terrorist organiza;on, and the insurance agency was legally barred from paying the ransom.  Sec-on 9.3: The Fallout  As the agency scrambled to regain control of their systems, the consequences became painfully clear:  Loss of data: The company was unable to recover crucial data, including client informa;on and policy documents, as they couldn't pay the ransom due to legal restric;ons. Erosion of trust: The incident severely damaged the clients' faith in the agency's ability to safeguard their sensi;ve informa;on, leading to a loss of business. Legal repercussions: The insurance agency faced numerous lawsuits from clients, further exacerba;ng the ﬁnancial strain on the business.  Sec-on 9.4: The Final Nail in the Coﬃn  With moun;ng legal fees, eroding client trust, and the loss of vital data, the insurance agency owner made the diﬃcult decision to close the company's doors for good. It was a harsh lesson in the importance of inves;ng in up-to-date technology and robust cybersecurity measures. 

 37  Sec-on 9.5: Lessons Learned  The story of this ill-fated insurance agency serves as a stark reminder of the poten;al consequences of neglec;ng cybersecurity.

Overview: A ransomware aTack encrypted cri;cal data and systems at an insurance agency, rendering them inaccessible. The aTackers demanded a signiﬁcant ransom in exchange for the decryp;on key. The agency faced opera;onal disrup;ons and ﬁnancial losses as they struggled to recover.  The S-cky Situa-on - An Inside Job That Compromised an Insurance Agency  Sec-on 9.6: Business as Usual, or So They Thought  In the bustling world of insurance, an agency was diligently serving its clients, seemingly doing everything right. They had invested in technology and followed cybersecurity best prac;ces, but they overlooked one crucial aspect—the human element.  Sec-on 9.7: S-cky Notes and Shared Passwords: A Recipe for Disaster  It all started when employees at the agency found it convenient to share passwords to expedite their work. Innocently, they wrote these passwords on s;cky notes, which they then stuck to their computer monitors, desks, and even oﬃce walls. LiTle did they know that this seemingly harmless act would expose their agency to a signiﬁcant security breach.  Sec-on 9.8: The Unraveling of the Agency's Security  One fateful day, a disgruntled employee decided to take advantage of this lax password management. Armed with an array of passwords acquired from the omnipresent s;cky notes, the rogue employee accessed sensi;ve client informa;on and conﬁden;al company data.  The malicious insider then leaked this informa;on, causing an uproar among clients and jeopardizing the agency's reputa;on.  

 38 Sec1on 9.9:  The A_ermath: Damage Control and Lessons Learned  Realizing the gravity of the situa;on, the insurance agency immediately sought external help to assess the damage and implement remedial measures. They took the following steps:  • Conduc;ng a thorough internal inves;ga;on to iden;fy the extent of the breach and gather evidence against the rogue employee.  • No;fying aﬀected clients and implemen;ng necessary measures to mi;gate poten;al harm resul;ng from the breach.  • Introducing strict password management policies, including mandatory password changes, the use of password managers, and the prohibi;on of sharing passwords.  • Providing comprehensive cybersecurity training to all employees, emphasizing the importance of secure password prac;ces and the risks associated with negligent behavior.  This sent the agency into a very long process.  Fortunately, no customer data was leaked; however, there were severe ﬁnancial repercussion.  Beyond legal, IT, and opera;ons, incalculable cost of labor, reputa;on, and loss of clients almost put the agency out of business.  They did have appropriate insurance coverages to help them weather the storm.   Sec-on 9.10: Key Takeaways for Insurance Agency Owners  This case study highlights the importance of addressing the human element in cybersecurity. As an insurance agency owner, you must:  • Establish and enforce robust password management policies, including the use of unique and complex passwords for each account.  • Educate your employees on the dangers of poor password hygiene, such as wri;ng passwords on s;cky notes or sharing them with coworkers.  • Foster a culture of security awareness within your organiza;on, emphasizing the poten;al consequences of careless behavior and the importance of vigilance.  • Implement access controls to limit employees' access to sensi;ve data, reducing the poten;al impact of insider threats.  Don't let a "s;cky" situa;on like this one jeopardize your insurance agency's success.   

 39 Chapter 10: To Outsource or Not to Outsource: Considering Managed Service Providers (MSPs) for Your Insurance Agency's Security  Sec-on 10.1: Weighing the Op-ons: Internal IT vs. MSPs  As an insurance agency owner, one of the most cri;cal decisions you'll make is whether to rely on an internal IT team or outsource your cybersecurity needs to a Managed Service Provider (MSP). In this chapter, we'll explore the beneﬁts of partnering with an MSP and why having a third party "police" their compliance can help you stay ahead in an ever-changing regulatory landscape.  Sec-on 10.2: The Advantages of Outsourcing to an MSP  Exper;se: MSPs specialize in providing IT and cybersecurity services, ensuring that your agency beneﬁts from their up-to-date knowledge, skills, and resources.  • Access to Exper;se: MSPs have a team of experienced IT professionals who specialize in managing and maintaining complex IT systems. By outsourcing IT to an MSP , insurance agencies can access this exper;se without the need to hire and train an in-house IT team.  • Cost Savings: Outsourcing IT to an MSP can be more cost-eﬀec;ve than maintaining an in-house IT team. MSPs typically oﬀer ﬂexible pricing models, such as pay-as-you-go or monthly retainer agreements, which can be customized to ﬁt an insurance agency's budget.  • Increased Security: MSPs can provide insurance agencies with advanced security measures, such as 24/7 monitoring, data encryp;on, and regular security assessments. This can help prevent data breaches and ensure compliance with industry regula;ons.  • Improved Eﬃciency: MSPs can op;mize an insurance agency's IT systems, streamlining processes and reducing down;me. This can improve eﬃciency and produc;vity across the organiza;on.  • Scalability: MSPs can easily scale IT services up or down based on an insurance agency's changing needs. This allows insurance agencies to remain agile and responsive to market condi;ons.  • Focus on Core Business: Outsourcing IT to an MSP allows insurance agencies to focus on their core business ac;vi;es, rather than spending ;me and resources on managing IT systems. This can lead to increased compe;;veness and growth.  Sec-on 10.3: Policing Your MSP: The Importance of External Compliance Oversight  

 40 While partnering with an MSP can oﬀer numerous beneﬁts, it's essen;al to remain vigilant and ensure that they are keeping up with the rapidly changing world of cybersecurity regula;ons.

Sec-on 10.4 The Advantages of Internal IT  Here are some reasons and beneﬁts an insurance agency may consider keeping IT in-house:  • Control: When an insurance agency keeps IT in-house, they have greater control over their IT systems and can customize them to meet speciﬁc business needs. This can result in a more tailored IT infrastructure that beTer supports the organiza;on's opera;ons.  • Knowledge of the Business: In-house IT staﬀ are more familiar with the insurance agency's business opera;ons, workﬂows, and data, which can be cri;cal in managing IT systems. This deeper understanding of the business can help ensure that IT systems are aligned with the agency's objec;ves and needs.  • Communica;on: In-house IT staﬀ are more readily available for in-person communica;on and can respond more quickly to urgent issues that require immediate aTen;on. This can be especially important for insurance agencies that require high levels of availability and up;me.  • Staﬀ Development: Keeping IT in-house provides opportuni;es for staﬀ development, as IT professionals can be trained and groomed for leadership roles within the agency. This can help ensure that IT systems are aligned with the agency's long-term strategy.  • Intellectual Property Protec;on: By keeping IT in-house, an insurance agency can beTer protect its intellectual property and conﬁden;al data. This is especially important in highly regulated industries such as insurance, where data privacy and security are cri;cal. 

 41  • Cost Savings: In some cases, keeping IT in-house can be more cost-eﬀec;ve than outsourcing to an MSP , especially for larger organiza;ons. The ability to customize and tailor IT systems to the agency's speciﬁc needs can lead to cost savings over ;me.  Ul;mately, whether an insurance agency decides to outsource IT or keep it in-house will depend on a range of factors, including the agency's size, budget, industry regula;ons, and overall IT needs. It's important to carefully evaluate the pros and cons of each op;on and make an informed decision that aligns with the agency's objec;ves and goals.  Sec-on 10.5: Keeping your IT Staﬀ in Check  When it comes to managing IT systems in-house, it's important to keep your IT guy in check. While having an in-house IT team can provide greater control and a deeper understanding of the business, it's also important to ensure that the team is held accountable and provides value to the organiza;on. One way to do this is by selng clear expecta;ons and regularly monitoring and evalua;ng their performance. This can include selng goals, tracking progress, and providing ongoing feedback. By keeping your IT guy in check, you can ensure that your IT systems are aligned with your business objec;ves and that you're gelng the most value from your investment in IT.  It is wise to have a 3rd party audit your system on a regular basis. A good provider will include the following types of checks and tests:  • Vulnerability Assessment: This checks for weaknesses in your IT systems that could be exploited by hackers or malware.  • Penetra;on Tes;ng: This involves aTemp;ng to exploit vulnerabili;es in your system to iden;fy poten;al security breaches.  • Compliance Audits: This ensures that your IT systems are compliant with industry regula;ons and standards, such as HIPAA or PCI DSS.  • Performance Tes;ng: This evaluates the performance of your IT systems to iden;fy any boTlenecks or areas for improvement.  • Disaster Recovery Tes;ng: This tests your ability to recover from a disaster or data breach, ensuring that your IT systems are resilient and can quickly get back up and running.

This can help prevent costly down;me, data breaches, and regulatory ﬁnes. So, while keeping your IT staﬀ in check is important, it's also 

 42 wise to have an independent assessment to ensure that your IT systems are secure, compliant, and performing at their best.   Sec-on 10.6: Making the Right Decision for Your Agency  Given the complexity and importance of the decision between an internal IT team and or an MSP, it is a wise idea to consider bringing in a consultant to help you navigate this process.  A consultant with exper;se in IT infrastructure and cybersecurity can oﬀer valuable insights, evaluate your agency's unique needs, and provide recommenda;ons on the best course of ac;on. They can also help you:  • Assess the current state of your agency's IT infrastructure and security posture.  • Iden;fy gaps or vulnerabili;es in your current IT and security prac;ces.  • Evaluate the poten;al beneﬁts and drawbacks of partnering with an MSP .  • Assist in iden;fying and velng poten;al MSP partners.  • Develop a transi;on plan if you decide to move from an internal IT team to an MSP .  • Provide guidance on maintaining compliance with relevant cybersecurity regula;ons.  • By leveraging the exper;se of a consultant, you can ensure that your agency makes the most informed decision, ul;mately resul;ng in a more secure and eﬃcient IT environment. This expert guidance will not only help maintain the trust of your clients but also provide a solid founda;on for your agency's future growth and success.  • They will also be able to evaluate several providers and thin out the possibili;es that will signiﬁcantly save you ;me.  Their goal, (and of course this is what I do as well!) in to place you with the right provider and help keep them delivering on their promises.   

 43  Chapter 11: To Cloud or Not to Cloud: Naviga-ng the World of Oﬀ-Premises Solu-ons  Here's a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of on-premises and cloud solu;ons for insurance agency owners.
