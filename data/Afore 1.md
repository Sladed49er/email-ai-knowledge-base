Hi Stephen, The proposal from Cyber Assurance Group regarding Checklight identifies valid concerns regarding Afore's current cybersecurity posture, such as fragmented oversight, inconsistent compliance, and the absence of a unified incident response strategy. However, rather than layering another fragmented solution on top of existing systems, a more strategic, enterprise-level approach is required. Enterprise-grade solutions like CrowdStrike, Sophos, and Microsoft Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) provide robust, unified cybersecurity platforms that offer superior endpoint detection and response capabilities. Leveraging these types of solutions enables centralized visibility, comprehensive compliance reporting, and consistent security management across the entire organization. The optimal cybersecurity strategy involves a top-down approach, beginning with centralizing and unifying Microsoft tenants, and G Suite environments if applicable. By consolidating these at the enterprise level, Afore can quickly achieve broad security improvements, simplify management, and ensure compliance across all business units. Starting at the top (tenant level) significantly reduces the complexity and time required to implement uniform security measures compared to a bottom-up approach (individual machine/network). Afore should consider engaging a third-party service provider, such as TPx, to manage licensing and compliance centrally. This ensures that control of cybersecurity policies remains directly within Afore’s governance, allowing clear mandates and streamlined directives to existing IT vendors. This approach does not require immediate replacement of current IT providers; instead, it clarifies their roles and responsibilities, driving compliance and operational consistency from the enterprise-level downward. The key advantages of a top-down cybersecurity approach include: 

• Centralized Oversight: Easier management, quicker deployment of security standards, and streamlined reporting. • Scalable Security Infrastructure: Rapid onboarding and securing of new acquisitions within an existing framework. • Enhanced Compliance: Simplified audits and regulatory adherence through uniform security policies. • Effective Incident Response: Unified visibility accelerates threat detection and resolution across the enterprise. By adopting enterprise-level cybersecurity solutions (e.g., CrowdStrike, Sophos, Microsoft ATP) and centralizing tenant management, Afore can significantly strengthen its cybersecurity posture in a more efficient, scalable, and sustainable manner.
