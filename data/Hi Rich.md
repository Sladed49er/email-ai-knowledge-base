Hi Rich,

I propose a change to our agreement.  It saves money immediately and will give you a head start on Virsage and the computer transition.

Virsage is delayed now for another week, and I propose that we delay it farther, until May 1st.  The delay comes from a complexity of the data transfer.  Fortunately, it will not hamper business as is, and it affords Biggs more prep-time.

In the meantime, instead of the expected $4,600 a month charge that you would be paying Virsage, I think that we could take advantage of the overage by completely revamping the system and reinstalling all computers with a new image.  This will iron out the bugs that we are experiencing.  I would set them up as a dual boot.  Day to day operations would run as they do now, and a second system would be on each machine ready to boot when Virsage is live.

This will be done in staging and will not affect work hours.  Also, the IT as it runs now will be handled by myself.

The project is a large scale non-invasive swap.  Iâ€™ve done this in mission critical situations, and since we have the time and some extra resources, I think it would be beneficial for Biggs right now.

This will include but not limited to:
All IT
Security System
Installing secondary Operating system on each machine (minus surface machines)
Implementation of reusable computers to those that have surfaces, (fixed device)
Removal of the Printers from the servers
Installation of printers and scanners to move directly
Guaranteed 80 hours of work time for the month of April

I request $4,000.00 over and above the $500.00 that Biggs Currently pays.  This would be for the month of April, and will save about $500.00 a month while adding flexibility and features to the system.  With the guaranteed 80 hours, that is about 1/3 my going rate, and Biggs has the priority on my time.

Let me know your thoughts,

Thanks,

Matt
