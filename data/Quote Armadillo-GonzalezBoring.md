Audian vFax + Fax (36 Months)
With an Audian Fax/vFax line, you can either set up a physical fax adapter to use an old
style fax machine, or you can use our vFax to fax electronically. 
To use an older fax
machine, you simply need one of our analog adapters (ATA) and it will plug directly in to
your fax machine, and in addition, we set up your fax for automatic incoming failover to our
vFax system in case of a power outage. 
With our vFax, any faxes received will be emailed
to your user email, and outbound faxes can be sent to a custom email address which then
is faxed to the destination by our system. 
A DID or Toll Free number must also be
purchased along with the vFax, but multiple users can use a vFax to send or receive.
