This proposal considers  3 initiates : 
1. Computers not in compliance and /or aged machines  and outdate d firewalls  
2. No continuity  for email platform and Office  Instillations not authentic  
3. Redundan cy of Internet and management  
The solutions:  
1. Archway h as provided a quote and will project manage as well as provide onsite instillation in 
the replacement of approximately  70 computers.   Also, almost all of the onsite firewalls are out 
of date or not up to a business class.  Included in th e proposal is the l abor estimation.  Summit is 
to supply the new machines and firewalls  through a Dell Lease.  
2. The solution proposes the move from a mix ed platform of Google office and Microsoft Office to 
one Office 365 subscriptions .  This will bring Summit into compliance for all users and  provide 
each user with an Office 365 mailbox .  All will be managed  from one portal brining consistency  
to the org anization . 
3. Internet is imperative .  The bandwidth  section when co upled with the SDWAN solution included 
in the proposal will assure uptime and sp eed of operation.  Each location will have two internet  
connection s.  We have taken in to account  the size of each office and right sized the speed for 
each.  
 
This will bring a unstructured situation into a repeatable and manageable  system with a standard 
procedure for all things considered : Computers, Internet, an d Licensing.   Also, over the period of 3 years 
there is a positive  return.  This is not an apples -to-apples  comparison  as the solution  is a vast s tep 
forward w ith advantages  that are currently not implemented,  nam ely Office software and backup 
internet connections .  
By taking these su ggested actions, Summit will streamline both it â€™s current operations , but will also eas e 
acquisitions and setup a standard procedure .  By doing so, costs are quickly cal culated, implemented  
and create efficiencies when bringing new offices un der the S ummit umbrella.
