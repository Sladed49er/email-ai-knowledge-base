Hi Eric, 

The case for Agency Management Integration:
 
Right now, Insurance Agencies rely on Agency Management Systems for their day to day operations.  It is an advanced CRM that is at the center of what they do.  Every Independent agent has one in place and cannot operate without them.  Because of their industry specific needs, they keep other such CRM’s at bay.  Even Salesforce has been unsuccessful at grabbing a foothold of the market share.  Alphabet (Google) even purchased a considerable share of Applied Systems as they know the market potential is enormous.  The largest player in this field are: 
Applied Systems - Epic, TamOnline
Vertafore - AMS360, QQCatalyst
Hawksoft Inc – Hawksoft
EZLynx – EZLynx Agency Management System
 
Because of the agency’s needs, these companies have begun to offer API’s for advanced vendor connections pertaining to VoIP such as customer lookup (Call Pop), call logging, and call recording.  There are of course other features, but primarily these are the most in demand.
 
Vertafore (according to a 2017 study) has 825+ companies utilizing their software, which I believe the estimate to be low.
 
 
Applied has garnered the majority of business.  Note: Guidewire and SAP are used by Insurance Carriers not Agencies, and Audatex is for body shops skewing the results.
 
I’ve been employed by several companies providing Agency Management Systems and know that agents are following the direction of their software providers guidance.  VoIP and internet-connectivity are primed for the right partner to come along.
 
The current Insurance specific VoIP providers offer solutions at approximately $40.00 a month which I know to be well over what other markets yield.
 
I hope this was what you had in mind Eric, let me know if I’m off or if you are looking for different data.
 
Thank you!
