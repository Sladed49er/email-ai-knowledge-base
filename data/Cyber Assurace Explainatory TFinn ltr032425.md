ATTN: Mike Cahill 
Based on the email I read (and responded to in context), there are several misunderstandings that I hope this letter can clarify as a summary:
Common sense tells us that each AFORE-acquired entity will either have existing security tools and security vendor relationships or they will have nothing. We have been saying all along that no one should care. 
AFORE has specific corporate security and related compliance objectives and your acquired partners' objectives, regardless of what/if any tools or relationships they may have in place, are not the same, nor should they be. 
The following list is not arbitrary. The deficits listed are compliance-specific:
AFORE does not have cross organizational visibility to its own assets (no aggregated view). 
CHECKLIGHT provides an aggregated view of all covered assets (it is the only monitored EDR at this price point that provides asset management capability (e.g., reveals security posture of each covered device).
AFORE does not have continuous monitoring of assets (that store PII) in place.
CHECKLIGHT is an enterprise class, continuous endpoint monitoring solution that integrates the same threat intelligence used by federal agencies, enabling zero-day protections.
AFORE does not have cross organizational event logging.
CHECKLIGHT provides full event logging.
AFORE does not have cross organizational/aggregated reporting. 
CHECKLIGHT provides on-demand, custom-configurable reporting.
AFORE does not have coordinated IR capability. 
CHECKLIGHT provides fully coordinated IR (automated and human-in-the-loop capability). 
The concern over timing is of concern to us because we have no idea why the concern exists. No agent at any acquired entity, or agency manager, leader, et. al., is going to have any interaction with CHECKLIGHT beyond installation, and when they receive automated status updates. CHECKLIGHT is known as a "set it and forget it" solution. There is nothing to learn here --zero change management involved. The system is fully automated and supported by on-shore customer service specialists. 

We can orchestrate that install process at the agent level, agency level or at the cross-company level via a 15- minute zoom meeting. It can all be done as individuals or in groups at your convenience (It's nothing more than a software download). 
We are offering a free trial, which will result in a free scan of all covered assets. We will produce a report of what we found. 
It really is this simple.
