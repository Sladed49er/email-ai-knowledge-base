### Section 1
"Three" devices, beasts or ordinaries of the same have a
special significance in heraldry.
First of all, there is the obvious reference to the Trinity in
the design that would signify observance of the Christian
doctrine.
Secondly, with many Arms it brings balance that is
steeped in tradition. To better understand this latter
scenario, we must look at the evolution of shield in
personal armory. Kite shields that were the most popular
from the the 10th-14th century evolved into Heater
shields that had flat tops c. 1250. This was the time of
heraldry's beginnings and when "three" objects were used
for balance in each corner of the shield.
Later, with the advent of the "chief," "chevron" and
"bend" three devices brought balance to these ordinaries
too.
blackBLACK
Sable (Archaic or literary English for black) or black, the
coldest of the colors, corresponds to lead. Black, or
"sable," is symbolic of sadness. It also corresponds with
winter and is a humble color, suitable for the deeply
religious. It denotes the qualities of knowledge, piety,
serenity and work. Engravers represent it with numerous
horizontal and vertical lines crossing each other.

redRED
Gules, derived from an Old French word goules or gueules
meaning "throats" translates into modern English as
"red" and is the military color for excellence and
fortitude. It is symbolic of nobility, boldness and ferocity,
and can also represent fire and summer. Some ancient
laws restricted its use to princes and their families. Red
corresponds to the metal copper and is denoted in
engravings by numerous perpendicular lines.
chiefCHIEF
The Chief is a horizontal band across the top of the shield
that stands for authority and domination of will.
The Chief has often been granted as a special reward for
prudence and wisdom, as well as for successful command
in war and is accordingly, one of the honourable
ordinaires. [19]
The Chief theoretically contains the upper 1/3 of the
shield, although it rarely actually does. The Chief is never
surmounted by any other ordinary (a simple background
symbol) except for in very exceptional cases.
The Crest
The Crest was worn on top of the helmet, and was usually made of wood, metal, or boiled
leather. It provided the double advantage of easy identification and the addition of height
to the wearer. The Crest for the surname Slade is described as follows:

blackBLACK
Sable (Archaic or literary English for black) or black, the
coldest of the colors, corresponds to lead. Black, or
"sable," is symbolic of sadness. It also corresponds with
winter and is a humble color, suitable for the deeply
religious. It denotes the qualities of knowledge, piety,
serenity and work. Engravers represent it with numerous
horizontal and vertical lines crossing each other.

### Section 2
The Human Head stands for honor. After all, the Head is
the center of knowledge, thinking and learning for the
body.
"The heads of 'blackamoors' or negroes generally refer to
deeds of prowess in the Crusades." [20]
greenGREEN
"Vert" (from the French word for green) signifies felicity
and pleasure. It was symbolic of joy, youth and beauty.
Green was also associated with the spring. The bearer of
the green is obliged to defend the peasant and all who
work on the land. It is expressed in engravings by lines in
bend, or slanting to the right.

sinking the battleship and killing 833 crew. The captain of U-47 became a war hero and celebrity for his
