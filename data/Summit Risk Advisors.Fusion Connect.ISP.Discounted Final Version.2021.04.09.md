Failure to comply with the above responsibilities can result in delays in your service installation, interruption, or complete loss of service, and additional charges.

### Section 3
Local Area Networking (LAN)
Your company will need to provide and maintain suite
cabling (Cat 5 or better) to cross-connect your LAN with
Fusion hardware and/or edge devices, computers with
network interface cards, network printers, and Point-of-Sale
devices. If your Company chooses to use an existing network
switch or purchase one separately, it will be your Company’s
responsibility to maintain and to configure your switch, as
well as any other component of your LAN, so that Fusion’s
phones will function properly with your LAN. Porting of Existing Telephone Numbers
Your Company understands that it could take up to 30
days and sometimes longer to port existing telephone
numbers from your current carrier. Your Company also
understands that the precise date and time of when the
port occurs is outside of Fusion’s direct control. Your
Company is responsible for correctly identifying all
numbers to be ported, including toll free numbers.
LAN Personnel Present at Activation
Fusion requires the presence of your Company’s phone
and/or LAN/IT network internal personnel and/or
vendors during activation of your service. Your Company is
responsible for any associated charges. Disconnect Notification to Existing Carriers
Your Company will need to cancel service with your
current and/or previous providers. Fusion cannot
disconnect your services from another carrier on your
Company’s behalf.
Climate Controlled Equipment Room
Fusion-provided hardware requires a climate-controlled,
dust free environment to perform properly. A Fusion
provided circuit cannot be installed if the power supply is
not properly grounded. Forwarding Telephone Numbers to Fusion
In the event your Company has opted to forward existing
telephone numbers to Fusion, your Company
understands that it is your responsibility to engage directly
with your current/previous provider to set up the for-
warding of any numbers to Fusion. Your Company is
responsible for any associated fees with your current/previous provider.
Voice Quality of Service (“QoS”) Equipment
Your Company understands that QoS Networking Equipment
Is available to operate in the LAN and helps to prioritize
VoIP traffic. If your Company chooses not to purchase this
equipment, it may be a requirement in the future should
your Company experience chronic call quality problems. Service Activation and Fees
Fusion will begin billing for Voice Services after the
Voice service is installed on new or temporary numbers.
Fusion will begin billing for new Fusion data
circuits once the circuit has been installed. Any Cloud
services will begin billing as soon as provisioning is
complete. The billing start date for all services may or may not
be on the same date.
Customer Provided Access
Fusion cannot ensure QoS for non-Fusion network
services. Should your company purchase Internet
connectivity from another provider, it is your Company’s
responsibility to provide adequate bandwidth for voice
Services and all required IP information before the voice
Service order will be installed. Services Billed in Advance
Your Company understands that Fusion bills for
services rendered one month in advance, along with
Prorated Monthly Recurring Charges (MRCs), and that it
will be invoiced for all equipment and non-recurring
charges at time of activation. Your Company also under-
stands that shipping costs will be invoiced separately and
at time of shipment.
Voice Install Timeline
Your order will begin processing once all necessary
Service orders and required solution documents have been
Completed, including a signed Service Order, a completed User
Detail list, a completed Network Design (if Fusion provided
Access). Other documents, such as a Letter of Authorization,
will be required prior to porting telephone numbers. Voice Install Delays Caused by Customer
If Voice service is delayed due to your Company not being
ready, Fusion may begin billing for services rendered.

Notes – In addition to the terms set forth in Customer’s Master Services Agreement or the Fusion Basic Terms and Conditions, as applicable, the following notes apply to
Customer’s use of the Fusion Services:
1. All hardware costs are taxable. Shipping is not included and is billed separately. Actual shipping costs may vary and will be assessed at the time of shipping.
2. Order does not reflect the Regulatory Recovery Surcharge or local, state, or federally mandated usage fees and/or taxes.
3. Fusion equipment that is leased or loaned to a customer at no charge will be assessed the appropriate transactional tax based on a fair market value established by Fusion. Laws
governing the imposition of transactional tax on leases of equipment vary from one taxing jurisdiction to another. If the statutes of a particular taxing jurisdiction require Fusion to collect and/or
remit tax on any form of leased or loan of equipment, Fusion will comply with the applicable statutes.
4. Fusion is not responsible for and will not pay for any third party costs, including labor charges, incurred by Customer for the purchase, configuration, repair, or maintenance for any Fusion
or non-Fusion-provided equipment that may be necessary or used to make Customer’s computer or systems compatible with the Services or Products. This includes charges for
internal/inside wiring and LAN charges. Such charges, costs, and fees are Customer’s responsibility.
5. Pre-qualification information contained in this document is based on best available information and is subject to change. Pre-qualification results do not guarantee service availability nor
does Fusion guarantee Service installation by any specific date. If the stipulated access technology is not available, another type of access may be proposed to Customer and substituted
upon Customer's approval, which may result in changes to the quoted MRCs and NRCs. Fusion will make reasonable efforts to find the least expensive access available that meets the
Customer's requirements.
6. Prior to, during and after the installation of requested services, Customer may choose to request that Fusion augment the Service order to provide additional services or remove services
from the Service Order. Depending upon the scope of these requested changes, verbal requests from the Customer and/or Customers delegated representative may be acceptable to Fusion in
which case Fusion shall notify Customer of its acceptance of said changes via email. In some instances Fusion may require additional written authorization. All applicable charges resulting
from changes requested by the Customer and/or the Customer's delegated representative, whether written or verbal, are the responsibility of the Customer and shall be deemed to be part of
this Service Order and subject to its terms and conditions.
7. Customers who purchase Fusion Voice or Managed Services with Internet connectivity acknowledge and understand that Fusion Internet connectivity Services may be activated, and that
charges for such Service may be invoiced and due, prior to activation of Fusion Voice or Managed Services.
8. If purchasing Voice Services, additional usage fees may apply as set forth in the Fusion Ancillary Call Rates Business Voice schedule available at
https://www.fusionconnect.com/legal/tariffs . Certain Wireless Broadband plans have monthly data transfer caps that, when exceeded, will result in excess usage being billed to Customer as
set forth in the Fusion Fees and Surcharges Guide available at https://www.fusionconnect.com/legal .
9. Certain state and federal laws apply to Customer’s use of Fusion Call Recording feature. In some states, Customers are required to obtain consent from all parties to record a phone call.
Customer is solely responsible for compliance with any and all federal, state, county, municipality, or any other jurisdiction laws, ordinances, statutes, orders, directives or rules governing or
related to the use of a device for the purpose of recording any wire, oral, or electronic communications traversing and/or traveling over Fusion’s network and/or facilities. Customer understands
and agrees that they are solely liable for compliance with such laws and regulations, and under no circumstances shall Fusion be responsible or held liable for such compliance. Customer
indemnifies and holds Fusion harmless for any cause of action, fines, penalties and/or damages, direct or indirect, civil or criminal, involving Customer’s recording and Customer’s use of
Fusion’s Call Recording service or any wire, oral or electronic communication traversing Fusion’s network or facilities.
10. Customer authorizes Fusion to obtain any credit information necessary and/or Customer proprietary network information necessary to provision the Fusion Service and to establish
Customer’s account. Customer authorizes release of said information by any and all third parties to Fusion and its affiliates. Fusion reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to decline new
Orders and to require Customer to post appropriate advance deposits for new and existing Services.
11. In accordance with Fusion’s Acceptable Use Policy available at www.fusionconnect.com/legal , and applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations, Fusion reserves the right to
take any action it deems appropriate (including blocking access to particular calling numbers or geographic areas) to prevent fraud or abuse in connection with the Services. Customer bears
the risk of loss arising from unauthorized or fraudulent use of the Services or Customer’s account.

This section contains important information on the availability and functionality of 911 services. Please read it carefully.
Customer acknowledges and understands that Fusion's 911 Emergency Service differs from traditional 911 service in the following ways: (A) 911 Service may not function if
Voice Services or equipment are not functioning for any reason, including but not limited to a power outage or an outage or other disruption of the Internet Service obtained
from Fusion or another provider; (B) 911 calls are routed to an emergency call center based upon the physical street address provided by Customer. If Customer provides
inaccurate information, does not provide timely notice of changes, or attempts to use the Service or equipment from another location, 911 calls may be delivered to a non-
optimal call center and emergency responders may be dispatched to a location other than the location of the 911 caller; and (C) in some cases the 911 call taker may not be
able to capture and/or retain automatic number or location information, or be able to identify Customer's phone number and location in order to call Customer back if the call is
not completed or is disconnected.
LEGAL - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:
By signing below, Customer is ordering the Services described in this Service Order. Customer’s use of the Services are subject to the terms of the Fusion Master Service
Agreement between Fusion and Customer, or, in the absence of such agreement, Fusion’s Basic Terms and Conditions found at http://www.fusionconnect.com/legal,  including
the Tariff(s) and/or Service Addendum(s) applicable to the Services described herein. Failure to adhere to these terms may result in delays in your Service installation,
interruption, and/or complete loss of Service, and additional charges. Fusion’s Fees and Surcharges Guide found at http://www.fusionconnect.com/legal  contains the optional
and miscellaneous Service fees associated with Fusion Services and is hereby incorporated into this Service Order. You represent that you are authorized to accept this
