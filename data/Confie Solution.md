Hey Pablo,

I hope all is well, and things are smoothed out a bit, at least on the Vern Fonk side of things.

I’ve been thinking a lot, and I’ve run into issues like this.  Granted, I don’t know everything involved, but I wondered if instead of elimination of current agency managements systems, instead an API was created to sync data into one platform where they could be conveyed to pertinent parties on one pane of glass.

This would allow for them to operate independently, and in the event you needed to separate them, (Say another acquisition of a part of Confie), you could easily do so.
