     Hi Jeff and Teri,  I’ve given a lot of thought to your IT and what I can do to help you get back to solid footing.  1) Transition your phone • We are checking into your phone contract.  If you are out of contract, then we can implement Shoretel.  Even with the approximate $500.00 implementation fee, you’ll save north of $600.00 with the new system. • Implementation of eFax will mean you will not have to have a fax line any longer 2) Machine Maintenance  • Install all Windows Updates and set the process to automate on times that the machines are not in use • Remove all anti-virus and assure that Microsoft Security Essentials are in place • Install backup software • Image both machines in case there is is a failure so that it’s less than 2 hours to install a new machine. • Utilize the spare machine to have an image ready to go incase of failure 3) Remote Access Software • Install Zoho Assist for remote access (only on request requiring a code from the user for me to get on) 4) Internet Usage • Implement the new internet sharing with Biggs • Cancel Comcast • Setup new WiFi connection for Mansur and guests
