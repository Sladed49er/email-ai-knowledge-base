By


Matthew Slade


Introduction:

Welcome to "The Insurance Agency’s Non-Techie Guide to Cyber Security” your trusty guide to navigating the digital minefield of cyber threats and regulations while still maintaining your sanity and sense of humor. After all, dealing with hackers and cybercriminals doesn't have to be as dull as reading through an insurance policy written in a foreign language!

As an insurance agency owner, you understand the value of safeguarding your clients' sensitive information. But in today's interconnected world, it's not just about locking file cabinets and shredding documents—cybersecurity is a vital component of your agency's overall risk management strategy.

In this book, we'll explore the ins and outs of cybersecurity with a particular focus on the insurance industry. It will cover everything from common cyber threats and government regulations to best practices and strategies for prevention and remediation. 

So, buckle up and grab your favorite coffee, tea, or adult beverage, (I don't judge) as we embark on this thrilling and informative journey through the world of cybersecurity for insurance agency owners. Remember, it's not just about protecting your bottom line—it's about safeguarding your clients' trust.

Chapter 1: Why This Book?

Imagine waking up one day to find that your fridge is sending spam emails and your toaster is plotting a cyber-attack. In today's world, such scenarios are not as far-fetched as they may seem. It's more important than ever for insurance professionals to have a comprehensive understanding of cyber security challenges. However, finding a resource tailored specifically to the insurance industry has been as difficult as explaining the cloud to your grandparents. As a result of this gap in the market, this book aims to fill that void, providing insurance professionals with a unique, specialized perspective that combines industry-specific knowledge with technical expertise. While the topic of cyber security may seem daunting, I hope to use humor to make the content more approachable and enjoyable. After all, laughter is the best medicine for countering the stress of potential cyber threats.

One note that would go well here, is that the days of managing your own IT internally are over.  There is no way any individual can practice and keep up with compliances on both Insurance and on the IT side of the house.  You should either have a third party such as an MSP (Managed Service Provider of IT) or internal IT staff.  The rapid changes and the risk of lost data far exceed the desire to save a buck!  Sorry, Aunt Peggy should not be both receptionist and IT troubleshooter.  I write this book with the assumption that you already have one of the aforementioned IT Staff, (EXCLUSIVELY IT!) or MSP…if not, do kindly get one.  I’d be happy to suggest a few that work exclusively with insurance agents.

This book is a guide and only that.  This is to help you be knowledgeable enough to discuss proper course of action with your IT or MSP. That is the Mission Statement of the guide, and my “Why”.  Too often we check the box that we have an MSP or believe our IT Staff is keeping us safe, however we need to know they are doing as they say.  If you knew a carrier was not going to pay out on claims, you would not put a client with them.  I’m hoping to equip you to be able to ask the right questions to avoid possible pitfalls and snake oil salesmen.

I invite readers to join on a journey where you'll learn to protect your business and customers from potential threats. Remember, a well-informed insurance professional who can laugh in the face of cyber risks is the best line of defense in this digital age.



Chapter 2: Understanding Cybersecurity Basics

Where There's a Will, There's a Hacker

Welcome to the world of cybersecurity, where mysterious figures in hoodies hunch over keyboards, typing furiously as they attempt to break into your insurance agency's treasure trove of data. While that may be a slight exaggeration, the reality is that there are people out there who would love nothing more than to get their hands on your clients' sensitive information. But fear not, dear reader! I’m here to help you understand the basics of cybersecurity so that you can keep those cyber rascals at bay.

Section 2.1: What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. In the context of insurance agencies, cybersecurity involves safeguarding client information, financial data, and other sensitive information that your business processes and stores.

Section 2.2: The CIA Triad - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability

No, I’m not talking about a secretive government organization here. The CIA triad is a fundamental concept in cybersecurity, comprised of three key principles:

Confidentiality: This principle is about protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure. Confidentiality ensures that only authorized individuals, processes, or systems can access and view the data. Confidentiality can be maintained through various methods, such as encryption, access controls, authentication, and authorization mechanisms. In the secret recipe example, only you and your trusted chef should have access to the recipe, keeping it confidential from others.

Integrity: The integrity principle ensures that data remains accurate, consistent, and trustworthy throughout its lifecycle. This means that data should not be modified or tampered with in an unauthorized or undetected manner. Integrity is maintained using methods like hashing algorithms, digital signatures, and version control systems. In the meatloaf recipe example, integrity means that no one alters or tampers with the ingredients or instructions, ensuring that the recipe remains authentic and produces consistent results.

Availability: This principle is about ensuring that information, systems, and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed. Availability is crucial for the smooth functioning of any organization or system. Maintaining availability involves implementing redundant systems, failover mechanisms, backups, and robust infrastructure to prevent and recover from potential issues like hardware failures, power outages, or cyberattacks. In the context of the secret recipe, availability means that you can access the recipe when it's time to cook, ensuring that you can use the information effectively.

In summary, the CIA triad is a foundational concept in cybersecurity that aims to protect sensitive information and maintain reliable systems by emphasizing the importance of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. By adhering to these principles, organizations can create a robust cybersecurity strategy and minimize the risks associated with unauthorized access, data tampering, and system downtime.

The rest of the book will attempt to direct you on the right path to put this into play. 

Section 2.3: Layers of Cybersecurity

Much like a delicious, multi-layered cake, cybersecurity consists of several layers designed to protect your agency from different types of threats. These layers include:

Physical Security - Measures taken to protect your physical devices, such as access control systems, security cameras, and secure disposal of old equipment. Depending on your office situation, some of course will apply while other wont.  For example, if the 2020 dumpster fire year ended up moving you into a hybrid or remote only situation, of course access control would not be necessary.

Access control systems:

Implement a multi-factor authentication system for access to sensitive areas, requiring both a physical ID card and a unique personal identification number (PIN) or biometric authentication.

Periodically review and update access privileges to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to restricted areas.

Install alarms on doors and windows that alert security personnel if an unauthorized entry is attempted.

Security cameras:

Place cameras strategically to cover all entry points and sensitive areas, making sure there are no blind spots.

Regularly maintain and test the security cameras to ensure they are functioning properly. Most of these systems are online or cloud based, (my preference) but it’s always good to regularly go in and make sure the recordings are operating as expected. 

Store video footage securely, with limited access to authorized personnel only, and establish a retention policy that complies with relevant laws and regulations.

Secure disposal of old equipment:

Develop a clear policy and procedure for disposing of old equipment, including storage, transportation, and destruction methods.

Use certified and trusted companies for secure disposal and recycling of electronic waste. In most metropolitan areas, there are several recyclers that will dispose of the material either for free or low-cost, and some will even pick it up.

Before disposal, ensure that all data is securely wiped from devices using appropriate methods, such as degaussing or physical destruction of hard drives. A few e-cyclers will certify the data destruction similar to paper shedding companies.
.
Network Security - Safeguarding your agency's computer networks from unauthorized access or attacks, including the use of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure Wi-Fi connections. 

Firewalls:

Both hardware and software firewalls should be installed, acting as bouncers for your agency's digital party, keeping unwanted guests out.

Firewalls should be kept in tip-top shape by regularly updating and patching their firmware and software, because even digital bouncers need to stay ahead of the game.

Firewalls should be configured to give a cold shoulder to unnecessary traffic, only letting in the cool kids (necessary ports and services).

Keep it current and new. The cost of a new hardware firewall pales in cost when compared to some of the other mitigation options.  Make sure it’s a priority and have an asset retirement plan for it no longer than 3 years. 

Wi-Fi:

Passwords should be regularly changed and disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). Your Wi-Fi should be secured with a strong password and encryption. Also, there should be a separate Wi-Fi network for guests, so they don't access your important data.

Periodic network security assessments and vulnerability scans:

These should be regularly scheduled. Think of them as your agency's digital check-ups, keeping things running smoothly. There are several tools as well as companies that provide this service.  Even the best technician can miss checking the right box.  It’s preferable to catch something that may have been missed when done by a security professional rather finding out you were vulnerable when you’ve been hacks. Any vulnerability found during assessments should be quickly addressed. An IT professional’s procrastination is a hacker’s best friend.

Endpoint Security:

Protecting the devices (e.g., computers, smartphones) that connect to your network from threats like malware and unauthorized access. There are a myriad of solutions, some of the most popular, (at the point of this writing) and in no particular order are listed below.

CrowdStrike Falcon
Sophos Intercept X
SentinelOne Singularity
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Section 2.4: The Human Factor

No cybersecurity discussion would be complete without mentioning the most unpredictable element: humans. Whether it's clicking on a suspicious email link or using weak passwords, people can often be the weakest link in your cybersecurity efforts. It's essential to make sure your team is educated about best practices.  It is important to invest in tools and policies to help minimize human error. Let’s face it, nobody wants their company's data in the hands of cybercriminals due to a momentary lapse in judgment for a too-good-to-be-true offer.

So, while we can't eliminate the "oops" factor, we can certainly try to turn your employees into a more cyber-savvy crew, ready to dodge digital dangers and keep your business running smoothly, without any unexpected "surprises" courtesy of sneaky cyber attackers.

It is difficult to pinpoint an exact percentage of cyber-attacks related to human error, however various studies and reports highlight the significant role that human factors play in cybersecurity incidents. Some numbers to consider include:

According to the 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), 22% of breaches involved social attacks, which target the human element, such as phishing and pretexting. In addition, 8% of breaches were attributed to human errors like misconfigurations and lost or misplaced assets.

A report by Tessian found that 88% of data breaches in the U.S. in 2019 were caused by human error.

A study by CybSafe, analyzing data from the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), found that 90% of cybersecurity breaches in 2019 were due to human error.

The 2021 Proofpoint State of the Phish Report found that 57% of organizations surveyed experienced a successful phishing attack in 2020, indicating that human susceptibility to such attacks remains a significant concern.

These figures demonstrate that the human element plays a substantial role in cyber-attacks and emphasizes the importance of addressing this aspect when developing comprehensive cybersecurity strategies.

Just like re-shopping a client’s policy, it is vital to continually check on your human factor, and tune it as needed.  Here are some solutions to shore up one of the most vulnerable assets, your employees. Again, most if not all these solutions should be available or offered from your MSP or can be outsourced by your internal IT.

Regular security awareness training: Conduct frequent training sessions to educate employees about cybersecurity threats, best practices, and company policies. Make sure the training content is updated regularly to cover the latest threats and trends.

Phishing simulations: Run mock phishing campaigns to test your team's ability to recognize phishing emails and reinforce their skills in detecting and reporting such threats. I’ll cover this in-depth further in chapter 3.

Real-life examples: Share real-life case studies and incidents to help employees understand the potential consequences of poor cybersecurity practices and the importance of following guidelines. If you don’t have any, just use the stories in chapter 9!  As a bonus story, I was employed by a company that had an employee purchase $2,500 of Starbucks gift cards on what he thought were the owners’ instructions.  This was done via text messaging and the scammer was impersonating the owner.  Fortunately, the employee was intercepted before turning the cards over to the scammer…unfortunately, those cards are not refundable.  A lot of customers had Starbucks that year, and it made for great employee appreciate gifts!

Encourage reporting: Foster a culture where employees feel comfortable reporting suspicious emails, links, or activities without fear of blame or punishment. Establish clear reporting procedures and provide feedback to reinforce good behavior.

Strong password policies: Educate employees about the importance of using strong, unique passwords and provide guidelines for creating and managing them. Implement tools like password managers to help users securely store and generate complex passwords.  I know they can be annoying, but they are essential!  No more “Password1!” or the more secure version “Password@123!”.  

By implementing these solutions, you can educate your users about the human element in cybersecurity and help them become a more proactive and responsible part of your organization's security efforts.

One example of a situation where human error played an exclusive role in a breach comes to mind. A user who frequently worked remotely logged into a Wi-Fi network at a familiar coffee shop. Although the network name displayed was the same as usual, the familiar splash page did not appear. Unaware of the deception, the employee proceeded with their regular work process, which involved entering passwords and data. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a case of Wi-Fi spoofing, where a malicious individual had disguised their network to mimic the coffee shop's name.

Fortunately, due to the security measures and backups in place, no permanent damage occurred. However, if these safeguards had not been in place, the user would have experienced data loss as their emails were deleted and their account was compromised. This incident emphasizes the importance of providing employees with proper education and training to avoid falling victim to such pitfalls.
Now that we've covered the basics, you're well on your way to becoming a cybersecurity maestro. In the next chapter, we'll dive into the common cyber threats faced by insurance agencies and how to recognize the telltale signs of an attack.



Chapter 3: Common Cyber Threats in the Insurance Industry

No, These Aren't Spooky Campfire Stories

The insurance industry faces unique cyber threats due to the nature of the data it handles and the transactions it processes. While I don't want to keep you up at night worrying about cyber ghouls, it's essential to be aware of these threats so you can take the necessary steps to protect your agency. Let's dive into some of the most common cyber threats in the insurance industry and learn how to identify them.

Section 3.1: Phishing

Phishing attacks are like those pesky door-to-door salespeople, except they arrive in your inbox. These attacks involve sending seemingly legitimate emails designed to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information, or to unknowingly download malware onto their devices.

Insurance agencies are prime targets for phishing attacks because they deal with a vast amount of personal and financial data. To protect your agency, be on the lookout for suspicious emails, educate your team on phishing red flags, and use email filtering and scanning tools.

Your MSP or IT staff should be running regular phishing test so that you’re in a catch and release pod before you’re caught by a real angler. There are multitude of software tools for this, and any IT Professional/Team should be doing this as an ongoing part of their service.  If not, it might be time to find another hatchery!

Section 3.2: Ransomware

Ransomware is the digital equivalent of a hostage situation. Cybercriminals use ransomware to encrypt your agency's data and hold it hostage until you pay a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency. These attacks can be devastating, causing downtime, financial loss, and reputational damage.

To defend against ransomware, invest in robust endpoint security, regularly back up your data, and train your employees to recognize and avoid potential threats.

Of the damage I have had to help to undo in my tenure as an IT Professional, this has been the most impactful, and not in a good way.  

According to a report by PurpleSec, there were around 304 million ransomware attacks worldwide in 2020, a 62% increase compared to 2019. Businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), were common targets due to their often-weaker cybersecurity measures.  This is the group that most Insurance agencies fall under.

Regarding the impact of ransomware attacks on businesses, a 2020 report by the U.S. National Cyber Security Alliance found that about 60% of small businesses went out of business within six months of a cyber-attack, including ransomware incidents. However, it's important to note that this percentage includes all types of cyber-attacks and not just ransomware attacks.  However, ransomware is the predominate method as of this writing.

Section 3.3: Insider Threats

It's hard to imagine that someone on your team could be a threat to your agency, but insider threats—whether malicious or accidental—are a reality. Disgruntled employees or those with access to sensitive information might intentionally cause harm, while others may inadvertently create vulnerabilities through carelessness or ignorance.

Protecting your agency from data theft by disgruntled employees or other internal risks in the realm of cybersecurity is a crucial responsibility and requires a proactive approach.

Firstly, it's essential to monitor and restrict access to sensitive data. Employees should only have access to files they need.  One of the most effective ways to manage this is by using Role Based Access Control (RBAC).  Whether they are a Agent, Manager, CSR, Receptionist, etc., access can be managed at sign in.

Secondly, this is not on the IT side of things but can have just as much if not more impact. Focus on maintaining a positive work environment and addressing employee grievances promptly. Disgruntled employees are more likely to engage in data theft or other malicious activities, so fostering a culture of open communication and support can help mitigate this risk. Regularly conducting anonymous employee surveys can offer valuable insights into potential issues before they escalate.

Lastly, ensure that you have a strong exit strategy in place for departing employees. Immediately revoke access to all company systems, networks, and sensitive data upon termination or resignation. Additionally, conduct exit interviews to identify any lingering concerns or issues that could potentially motivate a former employee to engage in data theft. Remember, prevention is better than cure, especially when it comes to safeguarding your agency's digital assets.

Section 3.4: Data Breaches

A data breach occurs when unauthorized individuals gain access to your agency's sensitive information, such as client data, financial records, or trade secrets. The consequences of a data breach can be severe, including financial penalties, loss of customer trust, and even business closure.
As a business owner, when it comes to preventing data breaches, it's important to ask the right questions of your IT department or Managed Service Provider (MSP). Here are some essential queries to help you ensure data security while maintaining a light and approachable tone.

Encryption: Kindly ask your IT team or MSP, "Is our data encrypted, both at rest and in transit?" Encryption acts as a safeguard for your data, ensuring only authorized personnel can access its contents.

Access Controls: Inquire about your company's access controls by asking, "Do we have effective policies in place to restrict access to sensitive information?" Role-based access control (RBAC) helps ensure that only those with appropriate permissions can access crucial data.

Vulnerability Assessments: Regular vulnerability assessments are essential for maintaining strong cybersecurity. Ask your IT or MSP, "Are we conducting routine check-ups to identify and address potential security weaknesses?"

Employee Training: Your workforce is the first line of defense against cyber threats. Ask, "Are we providing our employees with the latest training and education to help them recognize and respond to cyber risks?" Regular security awareness sessions can help your employees detect phishing emails, social engineering tactics, and other potential threats.

Section 3.5: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks

Imagine a swarm of bees blocking the entrance to your office. That's similar to a DDoS attack, where cybercriminals overwhelm your agency's network or website with a flood of traffic, making it temporarily inaccessible to your clients and employees.

While DDoS attacks may not directly compromise your data, they can cause downtime, financial loss, and reputational damage. To protect against DDoS attacks, invest in DDoS protection services and robust network security.

Now that you're familiar with the common cyber threats in the insurance industry, you're better equipped to defend your agency against these digital intruders. In the next chapter, we'll explore government regulations and compliance requirements, I’ll try not to make it any more laborious than needed.

Chapter 4: Government Regulations and Compliance

The Not-So-Secret Recipe for Staying on the Right Side of the Law

I know what you're thinking: "Government regulations and compliance? Snooze-fest!" But stick with us, because understanding and adhering to these requirements is crucial for protecting your insurance agency and your clients. In this chapter, I’ll break down the key regulations and compliance requirements you need to know, without putting you to sleep.

Section 4.1: GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation

I’ll make this very quick as most of the target audience is in the US. If you’re only conducting business in the US, you can safely skip this. However, if your insurance agency operates within the European Union (EU) or serves clients in the EU, you must comply with the GDPR. This regulation focuses on data protection and privacy, giving individuals more control over their personal information. GDPR compliance involves several aspects, including:

Obtaining clear consent for data collection and processing
Implementing data minimization practices
Ensuring data security and breach notification protocols
Appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if required
Non-compliance with GDPR can lead to hefty fines and reputational damage, so it's essential to familiarize yourself with the regulation and integrate its requirements into your agency's operations.

Section 4.2: HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

If your insurance agency deals with health insurance or handles protected health information (PHI), HIPAA compliance is a must. If not, you can skip this, too! This regulation aims to safeguard PHI and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI (ePHI). Key components of HIPAA compliance include:

Implementing administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
Establishing a risk management process
Conducting regular risk assessments
Developing and implementing policies and procedures related to ePHI
Violating HIPAA can result in substantial fines and even criminal charges, so be sure to prioritize compliance efforts.

Now this is not a book on complying with HIPPA, because that; believe it or not, is more involved than network security in my opinion.  Navigating HIPAA compliance may seem daunting, but I have some basic tips to help you start the process with ease.


Appoint a HIPAA Expert, Designate a Privacy Officer, and a Security Officer.  This can be just one person if your organization isn’t too large. These individuals will be responsible for developing and implementing your agency's HIPAA policies and procedures. They'll be your guides through the complex world of health information privacy.  This is important because a large amount of HIPPA requires Policies and Practices that require a bit of Attorney time. A necessary expense that works a lot like, well, an insurance policy!

Provide regular training sessions for your employees to ensure they're well-versed in handling protected health information (PHI) securely and responsibly. Keep the sessions engaging and interactive to reinforce the importance of HIPAA compliance in their daily tasks. This can be done by an outside third party, and I highly encourage you to seek them out. They will also guide you to compliance.


Section 4.3: State-Specific Data Breach Notification Laws

In the US, each state has its own data breach notification laws, requiring businesses to notify affected individuals and, in some cases, regulators when a data breach occurs. While the specifics vary from state to state, some common requirements include:

Prompt notification of affected individuals, often within a specified timeframe
Reporting to state regulators, depending on the size of the breach

Offering credit monitoring or identity theft protection services to affected individuals.
Familiarize yourself with the data breach notification laws in the states where your agency operates and create a breach response plan to ensure timely and appropriate action in case of an incident.

My advice on this would be to join an organization such as the PIA (Professional Insurance Agents), or the Big I chapter in your State.  There are other organizations as well, however I am very familiar with both of those.  They are the “Oracles of Regulations” for all things P&C.  These organizations also lobby for independent agents, so you’d be supporting an organization that will also support the industry!

Section 4.4: Industry-Specific Regulations

Depending on the types of insurance products your agency offers, you may be subject to additional industry-specific regulations. For example, agencies dealing with financial products may need to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which includes privacy and security requirements for financial institutions.

To find resources and information on industry-specific regulations like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and other applicable laws, consider the following:

Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Website: The FTC is the primary regulator of GLBA and provides comprehensive resources on their website. Visit the FTC's GLBA page (https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act) for guidance on compliance, including privacy and security requirements for financial institutions.
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Website: The NAIC is an excellent resource for insurance agencies, as it provides valuable information on various regulations applicable to the industry. Visit the NAIC's website (https://www.naic.org/) for resources, updates, and insights on industry-specific regulations.
Industry Associations: Join industry associations that focus on your specific insurance products. These organizations often provide resources, updates, and guidance on compliance with relevant regulations. Examples of such associations include the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America (https://www.independentagent.com/) and the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents (https://www.pianet.com/).
Legal Databases: Utilize legal research databases, such as LexisNexis or Westlaw, to access information on industry-specific regulations. These databases contain up-to-date legal information and can provide in-depth insights into applicable laws.
Consult Legal Counsel: Engage with an attorney or legal counsel who specializes in your specific industry. Their expertise will help you understand and navigate the complexities of industry-specific regulations, ensuring your agency remains compliant.
By utilizing these resources, your insurance agency can stay informed and compliant with industry-specific regulations, effectively minimizing risks and maintaining a strong reputation for protecting sensitive information.

Make sure to research and adhere to any industry-specific regulations that apply to your agency's operations.

Section 4.5:  Understanding the New York State Cybersecurity Regulation

The NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation, officially known as 23 NYCRR Part 500, is a set of rules aimed at financial service companies, including insurance agencies, operating within New York State. Implemented in 2017, these regulations were designed to protect consumers and the financial industry by ensuring that organizations have robust cybersecurity programs in place.

Key Components of the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation
The regulation contains a series of requirements that insurance agencies must follow to remain compliant. Some of the key components include:
Designating a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to oversee and enforce cybersecurity policies.
Implementing a comprehensive cybersecurity program and written policy.
Conducting regular risk assessments and ensuring timely remediation of identified vulnerabilities.
Establishing a robust access control system, including multi-factor authentication.
Encrypting sensitive data, both at rest and in transit.
Regularly training employees on cybersecurity awareness.
Developing a comprehensive incident response plan.

While the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation can be overwhelming, it's crucial to view it as an opportunity to strengthen your agency's cybersecurity posture. By embracing the change and investing in a robust cybersecurity program, you'll be better equipped to protect your clients' sensitive data and safeguard your agency's future.

Section 4.5: Staying Compliant

Ensuring compliance when working with an MSP or relying on an internal IT team is crucial for insurance agencies. Here are some suggestions to help your agency stay compliant with technology, regardless of your IT support model:

Establish Clear Policies: Develop well-defined policies and procedures that cover compliance requirements, data privacy, and security. These policies should be clearly communicated to your MSP or internal IT team, as well as all employees within the agency.

Due Diligence: If working with an MSP, conduct thorough due diligence to ensure they have experience with insurance agencies, a strong compliance track record, and a solid understanding of industry-specific regulations. For an internal IT team, make sure they are trained and knowledgeable in relevant compliance requirements.

Compliance Responsibilities: Clearly outline compliance expectations and responsibilities in your contract with the MSP or in your internal IT team's guidelines. This will help ensure that all parties understand their roles in maintaining compliance.

Regular Communication: Maintain open lines of communication with your MSP or internal IT team. Schedule periodic meetings to discuss compliance-related updates, concerns, or changes in regulations. This ongoing dialogue will help ensure that everyone stays informed and proactive in addressing compliance issues.

Training and Education: Provide regular training and educational resources for both your employees and your IT support (MSP or internal IT team) to ensure they're up-to-date on compliance requirements and industry-specific regulations.

Compliance Audits: Conduct regular compliance audits or assessments, regardless of whether you're working with an MSP or an internal IT team. This will help you identify potential areas of concern and address them before they escalate into significant issues.
Incident Response Plan: Collaborate with your IT support (MSP or internal IT team) to develop a comprehensive incident response plan for potential security breaches or compliance issues. This plan should outline the roles and responsibilities of each party and provide clear guidance on how to respond to and resolve incidents.

By taking these proactive steps, your insurance agency can effectively maintain compliance while leveraging the expertise and resources of your chosen IT support model.

In the next chapter, we'll dive into best practices for cybersecurity in insurance agencies, complete with practical tips and strategies to help you level up your security game.

Chapter 5: Best Practices for Cybersecurity in Insurance Agencies

Your Cybersecurity Toolbox: Tried and True Strategies

Now that you're well-versed in common cyber threats and government regulations, it's time to put that knowledge to work. In this chapter, we'll explore the best practices for cybersecurity in insurance agencies, providing you with practical tips and strategies to bolster your agency's digital defenses.

Section 5.1: Employee Training and Awareness

I’ve already gone over the human factor, but I feel this should also be listed again. Your employees can be your greatest asset or your biggest vulnerability when it comes to cybersecurity. Implement regular cybersecurity training and awareness programs to keep your team informed about the latest threats and best practices. Topics to cover include:

Phishing and social engineering attacks
Password hygiene and multi-factor authentication (MFA)
Consider a password manager
Safe internet browsing and email practices
Incident reporting and response procedures

Section 5.2: Robust Access Controls

Make sure your IT or MSP has implemented strong access controls, this is crucial for protecting your agency's sensitive information. To achieve this, follow the principle of least privilege by granting employees access only to the data and systems they need to perform their jobs. Additionally, use MFA to add an extra layer of security to user accounts.

Implementing strong access controls is essential to protect your agency's sensitive information. Here are some suggestions to achieve this effectively:

Principle of Least Privilege (POLP): Adhere to the POLP by granting employees access only to the data and systems necessary for their job functions. These should be regularly reviewed and updated for access permissions to ensure they align with each employee's current role and responsibilities.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security to user accounts. This requires users to provide at least two forms of identification (e.g., a password and a one-time code) before granting access to systems or data. If you do not have MFA, you need to put this in place yesterday!  If not in all 50 states as a law, I assure you that at least one of your carriers will mandate it.  Also, it’s just the right thing to do for yourself and your clients.  You wouldn’t patronize a bank if they didn’t have a second authentication like your phone to access your money, this is no different. 


Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC is used to define and manage user access based on their roles within the organization. This approach simplifies access management and helps maintain consistency in granting permissions.

Regular Auditing: User accounts and access privileges should be periodically audited to ensure they remain appropriate and up to date. Promptly revoke access for employees who no longer require it or have left the organization.

Secure Password Practices: Your IT or MSP should mandate the use of strong, unique passwords for all user accounts. Implement password policies that require regular password updates and discourage password reuse across multiple platforms.

Employee Training: Provide regular training sessions for employees, emphasizing the importance of access control, secure password practices, and reporting suspicious activity. Educate them on the potential risks associated with unauthorized access and the consequences of non-compliance.

Section 5.3: Regular Security Audits and Assessments

Schedule regular security audits and risk assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in your agency's IT infrastructure. This process can help you:

Detect unauthorized access or unusual activity
Identify outdated software and hardware
Evaluate the effectiveness of your current security measures

Section 5.4: Data Encryption/Email Encryption

Encrypt sensitive data both at rest (stored on devices) and in transit (sent over networks) to protect it from unauthorized access. Consider using tools such as email encryption, VPNs for remote workers, and full-disk encryption for company devices. Rather than dive deep into this endless explanation, please converse with your IT provider and make sure this is in place.

On the other hand, I will delve into this, email encryption. It is vital for insurance agencies for several reasons, and understanding the associated regulations is crucial for protecting privileged data.  By default, EVERY email should be encrypted.  The regulations can be as small as two identifying pieces of information to qualify it as mandatory.  This can be an email address and full name, a policy number and email address, a phone number and a name, etc. By default, assure that it is implemented this way.  There are several services that require little to no interaction for a recipient to receive the email.

Other reason for encryption:
Protect Sensitive Information: Insurance agencies handle a significant amount of sensitive information, including clients' personal, financial, and health data. Email encryption ensures that this data remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized parties during transmission.
Compliance with Regulations: Insurance agencies are subject to various data privacy and security regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and state-specific data privacy laws. Email encryption helps agencies comply with these regulations by safeguarding sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access.
HIPAA: Agencies dealing with health insurance must comply with HIPAA's Privacy and Security Rules, which require the protection of electronic protected health information (ePHI). Email encryption helps meet this requirement by securing ePHI transmitted via email.
GLBA: Insurance agencies offering financial products must adhere to GLBA's privacy and security provisions. This act mandates financial institutions to protect customers' non-public personal information (NPI), which includes data transmitted via email. Email encryption helps agencies maintain compliance with GLBA by safeguarding NPI.
Maintain Client Trust: Encrypting email communication demonstrates to clients that the agency takes data privacy and security seriously, helping build and maintain trust.
Minimize Risk of Data Breaches: Email encryption reduces the risk of data breaches caused by unauthorized access to sensitive information transmitted via email. This, in turn, helps insurance agencies avoid potential financial and reputational damage.
Safeguard Against Human Error: Email encryption provides an added layer of protection against accidental data leaks caused by human error, such as sending an email to the wrong recipient or inadvertently including sensitive information in an email.
In summary, email encryption is vital for insurance agencies as it helps protect sensitive information, comply with data privacy and security regulations, maintain client trust, minimize the risk of data breaches, and safeguard against human error.

Section 5.5: Backup and Disaster Recovery

Create a comprehensive backup and disaster recovery plan to ensure your agency can quickly recover from a cyber-attack or other catastrophic event. The questions that you should ask from your MSP/IT are extensive.  I was in Scouts growing up, and being prepared has served me well without fail!

Here are some questions you should ask about backup and DR solutions, including cloud and on-premises systems:

What is our current backup and DR strategy? Can you provide an overview of our existing solutions, including hardware, software, and the processes involved?
How frequently are our backups performed, and is this schedule sufficient for our business requirements?
What types of data are included in the backup and DR process (e.g., client information, financial records, emails, etc.)? Are there any data types that are not currently covered?
How are backups tested and verified to ensure data integrity and reliability? How often are these tests performed?
What is the process for restoring data from a backup and implementing the DR plan? How long does it typically take to restore data and resume normal operations in the event of a disaster?
Can you provide a comparison of on-premises and cloud backup and DR solutions? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
What security measures are in place to protect our backups and DR infrastructure from unauthorized access or cyber threats?
If we use a cloud-based backup and DR solution, where is the data physically stored? What are the data center's security certifications, and do they meet our compliance requirements?
How does our DR solution ensure minimal downtime and rapid recovery in the event of a disaster or hardware failure?
How is our backup and DR solution scalable to accommodate our agency's growth? Are there any limitations we should be aware of?
What is the total cost of ownership for our backup and DR solution, including hardware, software, and maintenance fees? Is there a cost difference between cloud and on-premises solutions?
How long are backups retained, and what is the process for data archiving? Can we customize the retention period based on our specific needs?
What level of support is available from our IT department or MSP in the event of a backup or DR-related issue? Are there any additional services or features we should consider for our backup and DR solution?

By asking these questions, you can gain a better understanding of your current backup and DR solutions, evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of both on-premises and cloud systems, and ensure that your business data remains secure and accessible in the event of a disaster or data loss.

Chapter 6: Policies and Procedures

Don't Just React, Get Proactive!

Taking a reactive approach to cybersecurity can leave your insurance agency scrambling to respond to threats as they occur, which can be both costly and damaging. Instead, shift your focus to developing a proactive cybersecurity strategy, which can help you anticipate and prevent cyber-attacks before they wreak havoc. In this chapter, I’ll guide you through the process of creating a proactive cybersecurity strategy for your insurance agency.

Section 6.1: Defining Policies and Roles

The need for agency owners to have policies and procedures in place for their business when considering cybersecurity is crucial for several reasons. These policies and procedures act as a foundation for maintaining a strong security posture, protecting sensitive information, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Policies will require cooperation from several sources, Legal, HR, Operations, and IT.  I’m sure I’m missing a few, but you get the picture.  This is a big undertaking but a crucial part of insuring a solid foundation.

Each will need to be customized, but here are a few that should apply to all:

Compile a list of all existing security policies and procedures.

Verify that each policy is up to date and has been reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders.
Ensure policies cover all necessary areas, such as access control, data protection, incident response, and network security.

Roles and Responsibilities:

Define roles and responsibilities for employees, management, and IT personnel regarding security.
Ensure that responsibilities are clearly communicated and understood by all relevant parties.

Vendor Management:

Review policies for assessing the security posture of third-party vendors and partners.
Evaluate the process for monitoring and managing vendor access to your organization's data and systems.
Assess contractual agreements and requirements for vendors to maintain appropriate security controls.

Compliance and Auditing:

Review policies and procedures for maintaining compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.
Assess the process for conducting internal and external security audits.
Evaluate the effectiveness of your organization's risk assessment and mitigation processes.

Section 6.2: Procedures

Procedures play a critical role in your agency's cybersecurity framework, ensuring that the organization consistently implements and maintains the best practices necessary to protect sensitive data and systems. Here are several reasons why procedures should be a priority for insurance agency owners when it comes to cybersecurity:

Standardization and Consistency: 

Procedures provide clear, step-by-step guidelines for employees to follow when performing specific tasks related to cybersecurity. This standardization ensures that security measures are consistently applied across the organization, reducing the likelihood of errors or oversights that could lead to vulnerabilities or data breaches. After all, nobody wants to be "that guy" who leaves the virtual door unlocked for cybercriminals!

Employee Accountability: 

By outlining specific procedures, insurance agency owners can clearly define the roles and responsibilities of employees in maintaining the organization's cybersecurity posture. This clarity promotes accountability and helps employees understand their part in protecting the agency's sensitive information and systems. Remember, in the realm of cybersecurity, teamwork makes the dream work!

Incident Response: 

A well-defined set of procedures for incident response ensures that the insurance agency is prepared to act quickly and effectively in the event of a cyber incident. These procedures can help minimize the potential damage caused by a breach or attack, reducing the impact on clients, the agency's reputation, and its financial stability. 

Compliance and Auditing: 

Regulatory bodies often require insurance agencies to follow specific procedures to demonstrate compliance with data protection and privacy laws. By having these procedures in place, agency owners can streamline the compliance and auditing process, ensuring that they meet regulatory requirements and avoid potential penalties. It's always better to be on the right side of the law, especially when it comes to cybersecurity!

Training and Awareness: 

Clearly documented procedures can serve as valuable training materials for employees, ensuring that they are aware of the organization's security protocols and best practices. Regular training based on these procedures can help reinforce cybersecurity awareness and create a security-conscious culture within the agency. 

Continual Improvement: 

Procedures provide a framework for insurance agency owners to measure the effectiveness of their cybersecurity efforts and identify areas for improvement. By regularly reviewing and updating procedures, agency owners can stay ahead of emerging threats and adapt their security practices as needed, ensuring ongoing protection for their clients' data and their business operations. 

Knowledge Transfer: 

Well-documented procedures facilitate the transfer of knowledge within the organization, particularly when onboarding new employees or transitioning between IT personnel. This knowledge transfer helps maintain the agency's cybersecurity posture and ensures that new team members can quickly become familiar with the organization's security practices. After all, there's no "I" in cybersecurity team!

Before I ended up in the IT world, I managed the McDonalds in Leavenworth, WA, (not the penitentiary!).  One lesson I took with me is that doing something consistently and making it repeatable removed a myriad of roadblocks. It allowed for consistent results from the small Bavarian town in Washington State to Moscow Russia…and it was all the same.  And I can verify this firsthand.  It impressed on me that a world away in a different country I could expect the same.

 Procedures allow for the same repeatable results, otherwise it is a very inconsistent experience for every client.

In the next chapter we’ll go over what happens when the ounce of prevention may not be the complete cure.
Chapter 7: Incident Response and Remediation

When Cyber Storms Hit: Weathering the Aftermath

In a perfect world, your insurance agency would never experience a cyber-attack. But, even the most prepared organizations can fall victim to incidents. In this chapter, I’ll discuss the importance of having an incident response and remediation plan in place and provide you with practical tips for managing the aftermath of a cyber-attack.

Section 7.1: The Importance of an Incident Response Plan

An incident response plan is your agency's roadmap for navigating a cyber-attack or security breach. Having a well-defined plan in place can help you:

Minimizing Damage and Downtime:

To minimize the damage and downtime caused by an incident, the following should be implemented. 

• Quick Detection: Set up systems that will quickly spot any cyber incidents, so your IT team or MSP can act fast to handle the problem. This helps to limit the damage and disruption to your business.

• Containment: Create a plan with your IT team or MSP to isolate affected computers and networks when an incident occurs. This prevents the problem from spreading and causing more harm to your agency.

• Recovery: Make sure your agency has a backup plan to restore important systems and data after an incident. Your IT team or MSP should regularly test these backups to ensure they work when needed. This will help your agency get back to normal operations as quickly as possible.

• Communication: Develop a clear way to communicate with your employees, customers, and partners during a cyber incident. Keep everyone informed about what's happening and how it's being addressed. This can help maintain trust and minimize any confusion or misunderstandings.

I know it’s nice to have a little downtime, but it’s much less stressful and far less costly when it’s planned.  An ounce of prevention makes for more time on beach with that Mai-tai! 


Maintaining Customer Trust:

To maintain customer trust during a cyber incident, consider the following:

Be Open and Transparent: Communicate honestly about the incident, the actions you're taking to address it, and any potential impact on your customers. Clear and truthful communication helps avoid the spread of misinformation and maintains trust between your agency and your customers.

Provide Timely Updates: Offer regular updates on the situation and the progress made towards resolving the issue. This demonstrates your dedication to handling the problem and helps maintain customer confidence in your agency.

Offer Support: Extend assistance to customers affected by the incident, such as providing guidance on identity theft protection or credit monitoring services, if appropriate. By offering support, you can alleviate customer concerns and show that your agency is committed to helping them navigate any difficulties resulting from the incident.

The best way to earn customer trust is to be transparent and relay your response to the incident to them. Keeping it concealed will only foster distrust further. You should always discuss with legal counsel what you are able to share.

This reminds me of a Christmas order that we placed.  We ordered, on what looked to be an unbelievable deal, 4 reindeer with light for under $20.00 to be put into the yard.  It was after the season, so we saw it as a reasonable closeout.  Upon arrival, we received 4 small cardboard-ish cutout no larger than a foot each with small LED’s.  We felt absolutely taken.  It was ordered through the largest retailer online, and to return them would mean we had to pay shipping.  We look back and will refer to it as the reindeer incident, but for the company that allowed it on their site to not step in and credit us on the account put a very bad taste in our mouths, and small deer in the trash.

To contrast this, we ordered a chair for my mother as she was having shoulder surgery and needed help getting up from a seated position temporarily. The chair she received just not the right fit.  Nothing specifically deceptive from the company, but it just didn’t fit her needs.  In one call and in less then 20 minutes, they credited her back the funds AND asked that we just keep the chair.  No resistance.

How you treat clients resonates.  For example, even though the company’s name in the first incident isn’t named, you likely know who it is.  And now they have free press! It’s the age old expression, treat others as you would like to be treated.

Ensuring Compliance with Regulatory Requirements:

To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for incident reporting there are a few steps.

Familiarize yourself with the reporting requirements specific to your industry and jurisdiction. This may include deadlines for notifying authorities, customers, or other stakeholders. Here are a few resources for local and federal regulations. 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/

Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach Portal: https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf

State-level data breach notification laws: https://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx


Documenting the incident and your agency's response is crucial for maintaining compliance, analyzing the situation, and learning from the experience. Here are some resources and tips for documenting a cyber incident effectively:

NIST Special Publication 800-61 Revision 2: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf
This guide provides best practices for incident response, including documenting and reporting incidents.

SANS Incident Handler's Handbook: https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/incident/incident-handlers-handbook-33901. This handbook provides an overview of the incident handling process, including guidelines for documentation.

When documenting an incident, you should collect information such as:

• Date and time of the incident discovery

• Description of the incident (e.g., type of attack, systems affected, data compromised)

• Chronology of events (a timeline detailing how the incident unfolded and was detected)

• Incident response team members and their roles

• Actions taken to contain and resolve the incident

• Details of any external support, such as law enforcement or third-party security experts

• Impact assessment, including financial losses, operational disruption, and damage to your agency's reputation

• Lessons learned from the incident, such as vulnerabilities identified, and improvements needed in processes, policies, or infrastructure

• Steps taken or planned to prevent similar incidents in the future, including changes to policies, procedures, employee training, and security measures

Keeping detailed records of the incident and your agency's response will not only help you comply with regulatory requirements but also enable your organization to learn from the experience and improve its overall security posture.

Notify the appropriate regulatory bodies and stakeholders as required, adhering to the established guidelines and timeframes.

Learning and Improvement:

To learn from a cyber incident and strengthen your agency's security, consider these steps:

Analyze the Incident: After an incident, work with your IT provider to conduct a thorough review of what happened. This will help you understand the root cause of the breach and identify any shortcomings in your current cybersecurity measures. This analysis will provide valuable insights to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Evaluate Your Incident Response Plan: Assess how well your incident response plan worked during the actual event. Collaborate with your IT provider to identify any areas that need improvement, such as communication, detection, containment, or recovery. Update your plan accordingly to ensure it remains effective in managing future cyber threats.

Strengthen Your Cybersecurity Measures: Based on the findings from the incident analysis and response plan evaluation, implement necessary changes to enhance your agency's cybersecurity. This may include:

Updating policies and procedures: Collaborate with your IT provider to revise and enhance your agency's cybersecurity policies and procedures. This can help ensure that your agency is better prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to future cyber incidents.

Improving employee training: Provide additional training for your employees on cybersecurity best practices, such as recognizing phishing emails, using strong passwords, and adhering to your agency's security policies. 

Adopting new technologies: Work with your IT provider to identify and deploy new security technologies that can help protect your agency from emerging threats. This may include advanced threat detection tools, encryption solutions, or multi-factor authentication systems.

This is a constantly evolving process.  Learning from what happened is the only way we can better prepare.  There is no solution that is 100% effective, but shoring up will have you better equipped in the future.  

Just as the restaurants that receive failing grades and are forced to close, once reopened, are the cleanest places to eat on this earth.  The same with A cyber incident. Assure you have protection in place for an aftermath.  Just like the insurance you sell, have your response plan ready!

Section 7.2: Key Elements of an Incident Response Plan

A comprehensive incident response plan should include the following elements:

Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of your incident response team members, ensuring that everyone knows their part in tackling a cyber incident. Think of it as a well-coordinated sports team, where each player has a specific position and purpose. In cases where your agency works with a MSP, these roles may be shared or coordinated with the MSP and legal. Key roles in an incident response team typically include:

• Incident Manager: This person oversees the entire response process, making crucial decisions, coordinating team efforts, and ensuring that the plan is executed efficiently. They also act as the primary point of contact between your agency and the MSP during the incident.

• Communication Lead: The communication lead is responsible for sharing information about the incident both internally (within the agency) and externally (with customers, partners, and regulators). They manage public relations, craft necessary announcements, and keep all stakeholders informed.

• Technical Lead: This role can be filled by an IT expert from your agency or the MSP, depending on the agreement. The technical lead takes charge of investigating the incident, identifying the root cause, and recommending appropriate technical solutions to contain and remediate the threat.

• IT Support Staff: These team members, which could include both your in-house IT staff and the MSP personnel, assist the technical lead by implementing the suggested technical solutions, such as isolating affected systems, recovering data, and applying patches or updates.

• Legal and Compliance Lead: This individual ensures that your agency follows all applicable laws and regulations related to the incident, such as reporting requirements and customer notifications.

By establishing and communicating these roles and responsibilities within your incident response plan, you’ll have a united front and a solid direction. Putting this into place will greatly reduce downtime and damage.

There’s nothing quite as chaotic and maddening as professionals running around in a panic with no defined role.  Chickens will run around without a head.  Make sure your staff isn’t doing the same.

Detection and Analysis: Outline the procedures and tools your agency, in collaboration with your MSP and/or IT Staff, will utilize to identify and examine potential incidents. This may include tools like intrusion detection systems and strategies such as log monitoring, along with incident reporting channels. Key aspects to consider are:

Intrusion Detection Systems: An intrusion detection system (IDS) should be implemented that can monitor your network and systems for signs of unauthorized access, malware, or other potential threats. An IDS will alert your team and the MSP when suspicious activity is detected, allowing for a swift response.

Log Monitoring: Collaborate with your IT provider to establish a process for regularly monitoring and analyzing system and application logs. These logs can provide valuable insights into unusual activity or unauthorized access attempts, helping you identify potential incidents before they escalate.

Incident Reporting Channels: Create clear channels for employees, customers, and other stakeholders to report suspected security incidents. This may include a dedicated email address, phone number, or an online reporting form. Ensure that your IT is also informed of these reporting channels, so they can quickly become involved in the response process when necessary.

Containment and Eradication: Describe the measures your team, in cooperation with your IT provider, will undertake to control the incident and eliminate the threat. This may involve actions like isolating affected systems, eradicating malware, and introducing supplementary security safeguards. Key components to consider are:

Isolating Affected Systems: Work with your IT provider to develop procedures for promptly isolating compromised systems and networks. This helps prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage. Measures might include disconnecting affected devices from the network or limiting their access to other systems.

Removing Malware: This will help to establish a process for detecting and eliminating any malware or unauthorized access tools present on affected systems. This can involve using antivirus software, specialized malware removal tools, or manual removal methods to ensure that the threat is entirely eradicated.

Implementing Additional Security Measures: After containing and eradicating the threat, work with your IT provider to evaluate your existing security measures and identify any necessary improvements. This may include patching vulnerabilities, strengthening access controls, or deploying additional security tools to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Recovery and Restoration: Outline how your agency will restore affected systems and services, including data recovery procedures and system testing to ensure a return to normal operations.

Notification and Reporting: Develop procedures for notifying affected parties, such as customers, employees, and external partners, as well as regulatory bodies when a cyber incident occurs. These notifications must comply with applicable laws and industry standards. Work with your IT provider to understand the reporting requirements specific to your industry and jurisdiction and ensure that your agency can meet any deadlines for notifying authorities and stakeholders. Establish clear communication channels and protocols to keep everyone informed about the incident and the actions being taken to resolve it.

Post-Incident Review: Create a structured process for conducting a post-incident review after the resolution of a cyber incident. This review should involve an in-depth analysis of the incident, including identifying the root cause, assessing the effectiveness of your response, and evaluating any weaknesses in your existing cybersecurity controls. Collaborate with your IT provider during the review process to gather their insights and expertise. Use the lessons learned from the review to make improvements to your cybersecurity measures, such as updating policies, procedures, and technologies to prevent similar incidents in the future. Regularly updating your incident response plan based on these findings will ensure that your agency remains prepared and resilient against evolving cyber threats.


Section 7.3: Incident Remediation Strategies

After responding to and containing a cyber incident, it's essential to turn your attention towards remediation. Collaborating with your IT provider, you'll need to evaluate and implement strategies to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Remediation strategies will vary based on the nature of the attack but may include:

Patching Vulnerabilities and Updating Software: Work with your IT provider to identify and patch any vulnerabilities exploited during the incident. Ensure that your systems and software are up to date with the latest security patches to minimize the risk of future attacks.

Implementing Additional Security Controls: Evaluate your existing security measures and consider implementing additional controls to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. This may involve strengthening access controls, deploying advanced threat detection tools, or enhancing network security.

Revising Policies and Procedures: Based on the lessons learned from the incident, revise your agency's cybersecurity policies and procedures to address identified weaknesses. Collaborate with your IT provider to develop more robust guidelines that help safeguard your systems and data.

Providing Additional Training and Awareness for Employees: Enhance employee awareness of cybersecurity threats and best practices through additional training sessions. Empower your staff to play an active role in protecting your agency's information by equipping them with the knowledge and tools necessary to recognize and report potential security incidents.

Engaging with Law Enforcement or Cybersecurity Professionals: In some cases, it may be appropriate to engage with law enforcement or cybersecurity professionals for further investigation, especially when dealing with severe incidents or potential criminal activity. Your IT provider may be able to offer guidance on when to involve external experts.

In the end, and after legal consultation, make every effort to make it right.  The main takeaway is that a company that conceals when it shouldn’t is far more damaging in most cases than the attack itself.  Just look at used car salespeople…their reputations have proceeded them for many years, (I can say this, I was one in a former life).  No matter how honest you are as a salesperson every time I started the process with a new prospect, I had to prove myself.  In an industry such what I do now, because of reputation I no longer must overcome that.

A good reputation precedes you and a bad reputation will end almost every conversation before they even happen.

Chapter 8: Educating Your Team and Customers

Knowledge is Power: Strengthening Your Cybersecurity Through Education

A strong cybersecurity posture extends beyond your agency's IT infrastructure—it requires the active involvement of your entire team and, in some cases, your customers. In this chapter, we'll explore the importance of educating your team and customers on cybersecurity best practices, providing you with tips and strategies for creating a culture of security awareness.

Section 8.1: Employee Training and Awareness Programs

As I mentioned earlier, your employees can be your greatest asset or your biggest vulnerability when it comes to cybersecurity. Regular training and awareness programs can help ensure that your team is well-versed in the latest threats and best practices. Key topics to cover in your training programs include:

Recognizing Cybersecurity Risks: Begin by identifying the various risks that could impact your agency's information systems and data. This includes both internal and external threats, such as unauthorized access, malware, phishing attacks, insider threats, and natural disasters. Work with your IT provider to gain a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks and how they might affect your operations.

Assessing the Impact: Once you've recognized the potential risks, assess the impact each could have on your agency. Consider factors such as the sensitivity of the data at risk, the potential financial costs of a breach, and the reputational damage that could result from an incident. Engage your IT provider in this assessment process to gather their insights and expertise on potential impacts and mitigation strategies.

Prioritizing Risks: Based on the assessed impact, prioritize the risks to determine which ones require the most immediate attention and resources. Collaborate with your IT provider to develop a risk management plan that addresses the most significant threats first, while also considering the cost and feasibility of implementing various security measures.

Even as you have expectations for how your Agents will treat your clients, make this just as important.  You work so hard to have a good first impression, don’t sully it by some data slip up.  Nothing like having to make the call letting someone know you didn’t value them enough to take the steps to protect what is most important to them.  You’re their trusted advisor, once the trust is gone, they are on to the next.

Section 8.2: Creating a Security-Conscious Culture

Developing a security-conscious culture within your agency can help ensure that cybersecurity remains a top priority for everyone on your team. To foster this culture, consider the following strategies:

Lead by example, demonstrating a commitment to security at the management level
Encourage open communication and feedback regarding security concerns
Recognize and reward employees who demonstrate exceptional security practices
Incorporate security awareness into onboarding processes for new hires

As mentioned before in in Chapter 6: Policies and Procedures, regularly review and update your training materials to reflect current threats and best practices.

The mundane can be the lynch pin.  Just ask The Harmon Tower in Las Vegas. Part of the CityCenter resort it had a little more than just a "bad hair day". It turns out the tower had a severe case of misplaced rebar within 15 floors, causing it to have a bit of a structural meltdown. In the building world, that's like finding out your skeleton's been installed backwards - not exactly ideal for standing up straight!

The initial plan was to just give the tower a "haircut", reducing its height from a lofty 47 to a more modest 28 stories. But the tower's problems ran deeper than just a bad 'do. An astonishing 7,000 defects were discovered - it was like a tower's worst episode of "This is Your Life".

This $400 million "oopsie-daisy" led to a financial game of hot potato between MGM Resorts, Dubai World, and the builder, Tutor Perini. In the end, they all had to say "goodbye" to a heap of potential revenue, and "hello" to a rather hefty court case.

The focus on what was supposed to be one of the grandest hotels in Vegas due to low bids and ignoring the basics, sunk itself before it even opened.

Section 8.3: Educating Your Customers

While your primary focus should be on training your team, it's also important to educate your customers about cybersecurity best practices. This not only helps protect their sensitive information but also strengthens your agency's reputation as a trusted and security-conscious partner. Consider offering resources and guidance on topics such as:

Identifying and avoiding phishing attacks
Protecting personal information online
Recognizing the signs of identity theft
Using secure methods for communicating with your agency
You can share this information through various channels, such as your website, social media, email newsletters, and printed materials.

Additionally, treating your clients and prospects to lunch and learning can be a great strategy. Not only will it equip them with valuable knowledge, but it may also land you some sweet deals. Plus, in the event of an incident, they'll be more likely to trust you (and not just because they're in a food coma). And let's be real, who doesn't love a free lunch? MSPs will be jumping at the chance to host an event like this - it's one of the most requested speaking engagements I receive (probably because it's one of the few times people actually want to listen to them). These events have always been fruitful for agencies, so go ahead and wine and dine your clients, and who knows? You might just seal the deal over a plate of delicious sandwiches.
Chapter 9: Case Studies: Learning from Real-World Examples

Lessons from the Front Lines: Cybersecurity Tales to Heed

Section 9.1: A Cautionary Tale - The Ransomware Attack That Shook an Insurance Agency

Once upon a time, in a not-so-distant past, there was an insurance agency that thought it had everything under control. The company enjoyed a solid reputation, a loyal client base, and a seemingly reliable internal IT department. Little did they know that their outdated technology and lack of proper investment in cybersecurity measures would soon bring their world crashing down.

Section 9.2: The Ransomware Nightmare Unfolds

One fateful day, the agency fell victim to a devastating ransomware attack. Their entire system was compromised—computers, servers, and even network switches. The attackers demanded a hefty sum in exchange for the decryption keys, and the company found itself in an impossible situation.

Desperate for help, the agency's owner sought the expertise of our trusty author to consult on the matter and remediate the damage. Upon investigation, it was evident that the internal IT department had not received the necessary funding to implement critical security measures.

To make matters worse, the ransomware attack occurred during the height of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The group responsible for the attack was designated as a terrorist organization, and the insurance agency was legally barred from paying the ransom.

Section 9.3: The Fallout

As the agency scrambled to regain control of their systems, the consequences became painfully clear:

Loss of data: The company was unable to recover crucial data, including client information and policy documents, as they couldn't pay the ransom due to legal restrictions.

The Sticky Situation - An Inside Job That Compromised an Insurance Agency

Section 9.6: Business as Usual, or So They Thought

In the bustling world of insurance, an agency was diligently serving its clients, seemingly doing everything right. They had invested in technology and followed cybersecurity best practices, but they overlooked one crucial aspect—the human element.

Section 9.7: Sticky Notes and Shared Passwords: A Recipe for Disaster

It all started when employees at the agency found it convenient to share passwords to expedite their work. Innocently, they wrote these passwords on sticky notes, which they then stuck to their computer monitors, desks, and even office walls. Little did they know that this seemingly harmless act would expose their agency to a significant security breach.

Section 9.8: The Unraveling of the Agency's Security

One fateful day, a disgruntled employee decided to take advantage of this lax password management. Armed with an array of passwords acquired from the omnipresent sticky notes, the rogue employee accessed sensitive client information and confidential company data.

The malicious insider then leaked this information, causing an uproar among clients and jeopardizing the agency's reputation.

Section 9.9:  The Aftermath: Damage Control and Lessons Learned

Realizing the gravity of the situation, the insurance agency immediately sought external help to assess the damage and implement remedial measures. They took the following steps:

Cost Savings: In some cases, keeping IT in-house can be more cost-effective than outsourcing to an MSP, especially for larger organizations. The ability to customize and tailor IT systems to the agency's specific needs can lead to cost savings over time.

Ultimately, whether an insurance agency decides to outsource IT or keep it in-house will depend on a range of factors, including the agency's size, budget, industry regulations, and overall IT needs. It's important to carefully evaluate the pros and cons of each option and make an informed decision that aligns with the agency's objectives and goals.

Section 10.5: Keeping your IT Staff in Check

When it comes to managing IT systems in-house, it's important to keep your IT guy in check. While having an in-house IT team can provide greater control and a deeper understanding of the business, it's also important to ensure that the team is held accountable and provides value to the organization. One way to do this is by setting clear expectations and regularly monitoring and evaluating their performance. This can include setting goals, tracking progress, and providing ongoing feedback. By keeping your IT guy in check, you can ensure that your IT systems are aligned with your business objectives and that you're getting the most value from your investment in IT.

It is wise to have a 3rd party audit your system on a regular basis. A good provider will include the following types of checks and tests:

Vulnerability Assessment: This checks for weaknesses in your IT systems that could be exploited by hackers or malware.

Penetration Testing: This involves attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in your system to identify potential security breaches.

Conclusion

And so, we find ourselves at the end of this quite remarkable journey through the labyrinth of cybersecurity in the world of insurance. As I reflect on my career in IT, I can't help but draw a rather amusing parallel with the insurance industry. In essence, we're like insurance agents for the digital world. We've spent our days forewarning clients of all the potential catastrophes that could befall them, some of which seem as unlikely as being struck by lightning while playing the tuba on a unicycle. Yet, just like you, we've seen some unfortunate souls who didn't heed our advice and ended up living out those very scenarios.

Much like being an insurance agent, working in IT can sometimes feel like being the harbinger of doom. We're often the ones to break the news that no, "password123" is not a good password, and yes, clicking on that email from the Nigerian prince was indeed a bad idea. We've seen it all, from ransomware nightmares to data breaches that make you want to grab a tub of ice cream and a blanket and just hibernate until it's all over.

But just as you have insurance to protect your clients, we have cybersecurity. We're the umbrella in the storm of cyber threats, the life raft in the sea of data breaches, and the security blanket when the boogeyman of phishing attempts lurks in the closet.

In the end, navigating the digital world's risks and rewards is not unlike navigating the complexities of insurance policies. It may not always be easy, it may sometimes be frustrating, and yes, there will be times when it feels like the digital equivalent of trying to sell life insurance to a cat with nine lives. But when you look back on it all, you realize that it's been one heck of a ride.

And so, dear reader, whether you're an IT veteran or a non-techie insurance agent, I leave you with this. May your passwords be strong, your servers be secure, and your coffee be strong enough to get you through that Monday morning meeting about cybersecurity. Because at the end of the day, we're all in this together, trying to make the digital world a safer place, one secure password at a time. 

Just remember, the next time you're having a bad day in the office, spare a thought for us in IT. We're probably busy explaining to someone why sticking their password on a sticky note and attaching it to their monitor isn't the best idea. Here's to the end of one journey and the start of another, and remember: Cybersecurity - don't leave your desk without it!
