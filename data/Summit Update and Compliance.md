This proposal considers 3 initiatives: 
1.Computers not in compliance and/or aged machines and outdated firewalls
2.No continuity for email platform and Office installation not authentic
3.Redundancy of Internet and management
Th
e solutions:  
1.Archway has provided a quote and will project manage as well as provide onsite installation in  
the replacement of approximately 70  computers.   Also,  almost all  of the onsite firewalls are out  
of date or not up to a business class.  Included i n the proposal is the labor estimation.  Summit is  
to supply the new machines and firewalls through a Dell Lease.
2.The solution proposes the move from a mixed platform of Google office and Microsoft Office to  
one Office 365 subscriptions.  This will bring S ummit into compliance for all users and provide  
each user with an Office 365 mailbox.  All will be managed from one portal bringing consistency  
to the organization.
3.Internet is imperative.  The bandwidth section when coupled with the S DWAN  solution i ncluded  
in the proposal will assure uptime and speed of operation.  Each location will have two internet  
connections.  We have taken into account the size of each office and right sized the speed for  
each.
This will bring a unstructured situation into a repeatable and manageable system with a standard 
procedure for all things considered: Computers,  Internet, and Licensing.  Also, over the period of three  
years there is a positive return.  This is not an apples-t o-apples comparison as the solution is a vast step 
forward wit h advantages that are currently not implemented,  namely Office software and backup 
Internet connections. 
By taking these sug gested actions, S ummit will streamline both i tâ€™s current operations and ease 
acquisitions by standardizing implementations which will create efficiencies when brining acquisitions 
under the Summit umbrella.Proposal: Summit Risk Compliance and
