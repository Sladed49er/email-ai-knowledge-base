 Case Study: Transforming IT Efficiency with Virsage for Vern Fonk Insurance Client Overview Vern Fonk Insurance, a leading independent insurance agency, was using Packet Drivers as their IT provider. As the agency grew, it faced increasing costs and inefficiencies due to its on-premise infrastructure, licensing complexities, and ongoing maintenance. Seeking a more scalable and cost-effective IT solution, Vern Fonk explored alternative providers and selected Virsage WorkPlace to modernize its IT operations.  Challenges The primary pain points experienced with Packet Drivers included: â€¢ Escalating Software & Licensing Costs o The agency paid for individual Microsoft Windows Server, Windows CALs, Microsoft Office, and Citrix licenses, which resulted in unpredictable and rising costs. â€¢ High Infrastructure & Maintenance Costs o Packet Drivers required expensive hardware upgrades, including storage, SonicWall licenses, and server replacements, alongside ongoing Colo Hosting and Amazon EC2 cloud costs. â€¢ Scalability & Growth Limitations o With projected 17% year-over-year growth, the agency struggled with maintaining an optimal licensing strategy and managing IT expansion under Packet Drivers. â€¢ Operational Inefficiencies o Managing IT internally, dealing with downtime, and coordinating third-party IT support placed additional burdens on the agency's operations.
