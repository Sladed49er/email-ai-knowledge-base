Current Configuration:

On premises server
Onsite ASA (firewall) with advanced configuration
Separate Internet connection for Data
Separate Internet connection for Voice (phones)
Multi-Switch configuration each with complex routing
Desktop towers and Tablets
Install programs
Maintenance from offsite third party for onsite devices
Third party vendor for IT onsite service
Internal IT emergent service handled by internal personnel
Limited remote access allowed by VPN
Disaster Plan 24-hour service
Offsite backup and failure recovery

The current state of the system is functional and with a standard set to backup tools and maintenance.  Because of varying partners in the history of the system, it has become somewhat undocumented and in some cases un-know as to the state and of which device controls certain functions.  There are several points of possible failure, and even in the case of an emergency to rebuild the network such as the phones and the server network and it’s routing would take days.  The most necessary points that need to be addressed are below.

The Network Stack
Multiple switches with complex setup that is undocumented internally.  If one were to fail there would be no way to rebuild it from a backup or from documentation.
Port mapping and outdated maps of the network need to be documented as well.  If there came an issue with the network it would greatly reduce the time in trouble shooting
Server Planning
The current server is functioning well as of now, but there will need to be a replacement plan in place if it is to be maintained.  
A backup from “bare metal” if there is a machine failure at current state would take days to rebuild if it were done from the online backup
Phone configuration
Currently limited to the one internet connection.  An outage on this line will cause the phones to fail
Documentation on phones is outdated
Network constrains do not allow for Biggs to take advantage of new upgrades to the internet due to complex and undocumented switching
PC Standardization
Slow to install and could cause delays in production per user as they are down.  Rich does a great job making sure they are up and running, however in the case of multiple failures and coordinating a disaster recovery could be hampering
Rich’s time is consumed by many hours a week in dealing with PC and technical issues in setting up PC’s 
Old machines could be used in production if there is a plan and a way to use virtual desktops in the cloud
Security
Current routers are outdated and do not have the current firmware and are not up to the new standards
A breach in the system locally or by a user could hold Biggs liable for security attacks
Employees that depart or if one became malicious could remove data from the premises
Compliancy up to the standards of HIPPA regulations lacking
Support
Currently there are multiple places you need to turn for support
Complications on who to call as multiple venders support different devices
If there were a failure, would need to be the on onsite to help, restricting his freedom because of emergencies and taking him away from what he does best

Proposed Solution

Virtualize the server
Update the ASA in software
Merge data and voice lines and make them into a redundant system
Merge switches and eliminate complex routing
Move from desktop computers to Thin Clients that require no maintenance
Virtualize the entire office
Consolidate into the cloud
One backup every night of the complete system
Full remote access (allowed on a per user basis decided by management)
Disaster recovery in the event of natural disaster/fire/etc

By virtualizing the entire network for Biggs insurance, removing the servers and placing them in the cloud you eliminate the need for a complex network.  You also eliminate the need for a backup or disaster recovery plan.  All will operate in the cloud from an offsite or even home computer if needed.  Any device that is internet enabled can have access to the system on a secured connection beyond any HIPPA regulation.

The Network Stack
The current equipment can still be used but simplified.  Current complex configuration will be removed and the firewall and router will be basic connections, because there is no data onsite
Port mapping will be completed and in the case of a network port outage it will be replaced within minutes
Server
The server will be virtualized in the cloud, there will never be a need to buy another server, or update the equipment. 
All changes to the system will be made in a test environment in the future to eliminate glitches
Phone Configuration
All will be mapped and simplified
Replacement system with little to no increase in current fee’s and pricing and there will be no need for layout of cash for phone complex phone systems in the future

PC Standardization
Because it is virtual, there will be no need for desktop computers
Tablets will move to only 3-4 and be checked out as needed
PC Costs will drop from about $1,400.00 to $200.00 and there will be no configuration or downtime
Security
Because there will be no data onsite, there is no need for complex configuration
Citrix Virtualization that will be done by the vendor is beyond HIPPA compliancy and will reduce liability for BIGGS
Lockdown of data so that employees cannot have access to remove data
Complete compliancy with government and company regulations
Support
You will move to one point of contact for all tech needs that operate 24/7 with no additional cost so the service.

The New System

Virtualization has been occurring for years and is a stable and proven technology.  My years with rapidly growing and established insurance companies has proven time and time again this is the way to go.

Fortune 500 companies use this as a standard and until recently the costs have been prohibitive.  Costs have fallen and it has become a necessity to simplify IT on the Small to Medium business sector.

Currently the hurdles in getting there are limited to knowledge on the transition and to vet out the solutions in an accurate and documented matter.  Virtualization will be the mainstay soon, and companies will have to move this way.  Getting the transition only bolsters the positions of the companies that get their first and allow them to be progressive and embrace profit centers they may not even realize exist.

This simplifies the experience for clients, the business, as well as the employees that work there every day.

Cost Analysis and Projections

All work above will be completed in the term of 2 months.  There will be a 1 month duplicate of agreement for the transition of the independent consultant (Matt Slade) to replace the vendor (Paperwise) as the IT provider.  At the end of the transition period, or sooner if completed, Biggs Insurance Services will be transferred to either Virsage, at which point Matt Slade will provide all requested Biggs Insurance Services technology needs, (directly related to business) for the remainder of the calendar 2017 year at $500 a month for up to 20 hours a month.
