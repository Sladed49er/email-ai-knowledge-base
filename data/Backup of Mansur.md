Hi Jeff and Teri,

I’ve given a lot of thought to your IT and what I can do to help you get back to solid footing.

Transition your phone
We are checking into your phone contract.  If you are out of contract, then we can implement Shoretel.  Even with the approximate $500.00 implementation fee, you’ll save north of $600.00 with the new system.
Implementation of eFax will mean you will not have to have a fax line any longer
Machine Maintenance 
Install all Windows Updates and set the process to automate on times that the machines are not in use
Remove all anti-virus and assure that Microsoft Security Essentials are in place
Install backup software
Image both machines in case there is is a failure so that it’s less than 2 hours to install a new machine.
Utilize the spare machine to have an image ready to go incase of failure
Remote Access Software
Install Zoho Assist for remote access (only on request requiring a code from the user for me to get on)
Internet Usage
Implement the new internet sharing with Biggs
Cancel Comcast
Setup new WiFi connection for Mansur and guests



















I offer my clients two options, and because I will be up here every three weeks, I will be able to assist on site for anything that needs attention onsite. 

Option One
$500.00 per person per year, provides for 10 hours of IT service per user per year (retainer)

All onsite and remove hours count towards that total
After the 10 hours are met, (20 in this case) then it will be $125.00/hr after
IT discussions also count against these hours
Option Two
$1,000.00 per person per year, Provided 15 hours of IT service per user per year. (retainer)
All of the above services would count against the hours
