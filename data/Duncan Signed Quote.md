## Content (By Sections)

### Section 1
All of the Terms in this Agreement are in addition to Our General Terms and Conditions, which can be found 
at https://www.thebrookfieldgroup.com/legal. By signing this Agreement, you also agree to those General Terms and Conditions. For any 
terms that exist in both, the terms in this Agreement will override.

### Section 2
The minimum term that You have agreed to use Our Services is outlined in Our Proposal to you and is referred to as the Commitment 
Term.  
The Commitment Term begins on the first day of the next month (after the date of accepting Our Proposal).  
After the expiration of the Committed Term, an extension of the Term will automatically commence equal to the period of the original 
Committed Term, unless earlier terminated as outlined in the ‘Termination’ section below.

### Section 3
You agree that if You need to Terminate this Agreement before the end of the Commitment Term, You agree to pay Us the current 
Agreement Fee multiplied by the number of months left in the current Commitment Term within 14 days of providing Us Notification of 
Termination.  
Should any pricing adjustments be made to this Agreement during a Commitment Term, the Plan Fee used to calculate any Termination 
Payment will be based on the latter of the original Proposal or any updated Pricing adjustments made in writing from Us to You. 
All Termination requests must be made in writing to the following:

### Section 4
While We strive to provide You with the best possible support at all levels, We leave an open communication channel for You in the event 
You ever need to Escalate an issue further.
If you ever need to escalate a Service Request or Issue, you agree to use the following escalation order to ensure the quickest possible 
resolution time. 
Account Manager 
Name: Daniel Abdallah 
Email: Daniel.abdallah@thebrookfieldgroup.com 
 
Service Manager 
Name: Gerry Shoulders 
Email: Gerry.Shoulders@thebrookfieldgroup.com 
 
Please note that these Escalation Points are not to be used for logging Service Requests. All Service Requests must be logged through the 
normal methods as outlined in our General Terms and Conditions.

### Section 5
We agree to respond to your Service Requests within the Maximum time frames set out in Appendix A. 
If the support request is logged outside Our Business Hours Our Response Time Guarantee does not apply. We will still work on your 
Service Request as fast as possible, however, it will be on a best-effort basis. 
Response Times are calculated as per the Definition outlined in Appendix E. 
Response Times are Guaranteed the maximum times to respond to a Service Request, not necessarily resolve a service request. 
Please see Appendix B for a list of the types of Service Requests that our Response Time Guarantee does not apply to. 
Business Hours: 8am - 8pm EST
Oncall Hours: 8pm - 8am EST

### Section 6
We classify Service Request priorities as shown in Appendix A. 
These priorities tie directly in with Our Response Time Guarantee to provide you with information about how quickly We will respond to 
Your issues.  
If you require a Service Request that would normally be classed as a High, Medium or Low priority to be escalated and remediated as a 
Critical Priority – then You can request an “Emergency Upgrade”.  
As we know, not everything in life fits into a box so the final decision on classifying the priority of an issue will be made by Our responding 
technician. 
WHAT’S COVERED 
As part of this Agreement, we endeavor to include all the day-to-day IT support items that are typically required to run a typical Business 
Technology Baseline Infrastructure. 
You can see a list of all the items we will cover under this Agreement in Appendix C. 
It’s important to note that anything not included in Appendix C is explicitly excluded from Your Agreement and will be billed at our normal 
rates as found on our Rate Schedule. From time to time, we may provide support for items not explicitly included in Appendix C without 
charge – however, we will do this at our sole discretion.

### Section 7
If your proposal includes a Technology Business Review, We will provide a Business Review Session at the set interval.
In this session, we run through items such as, but not limited to, the following: 
Previous quarter Ticket Metrics 
Review of Services provided 
Review of the invoice, contract, and contracted items 
Your Technology and Business Plans for the upcoming quarter(s) 
Refresh Cycle Update / Minimum Standards 
Technology Budget Update 
Technology Update and Roadmap 
Anything else you need to raise/discuss related to your Technology or Business 
 
You agree to allocate 2 hours to each of these sessions to ensure that We can provide our Service to You effectively. You agree to give us 
at least 5 Business Days' notice if you need to re-schedule or amend an upcoming Technology Business Review. If You don’t give us at 
least 5 Business Days’ notice, that quarter's Business Review will still be counted as used.

### Section 8
There are some Hardware and Software requirements that You need to have in place in order for Us to meet Our Service obligations, these 
can be found here www.thebrookfieldgroup.com/rtp. We will update this list from time to time as certain technologies age and other 
technologies are released and tested by us. If You do not have all these Minimum Standards in place before Your Agreement start date, we 
will work with you on a plan to bring your Technology up to our Minimum Standards. We understand that this may take some time 
depending on timing and budgets so we will do our best to support any items that do not currently meet Our Minimum Standards. However, 
if an item requiring support does not meet our Minimum Standards, it will be at our sole discretion whether we charge You for any time 
incurred for supporting that Item.

### Section 9
The list in Appendix D shows all the Approved software that can be installed on any of the Computers or Devices covered by this 
Agreement.  
This doesn’t mean that all other software can’t be installed – it simply means that if other software is installed, then it’s up to our sole 
discretion whether we cover any Service Requests related to any other Software under the scope of this Agreement. If We deem any 
Service Requests to be Out of the scope of This Agreement, We will ask for Your approval before performing any work. This list may 
change over the time we work together under this Agreement. We will email any updates to this list to Your Primary IT Contact. 
MANUFACTURER/VENDOR MAINTENANCE, SUPPORT, AND WARRANTY
You are required to maintain valid support, warranty, and maintenance agreement for all hardware, software, and technology assets proved 
by manufacturers or vendors. This is not to suggest that you cannot use equipment without such agreements in place; rather, it implies that 
any support request related to assets lacking current manufacture or vendor support agreements may be solely at our discretion to cover 
under the scope of this Agreement. We will monitor your technology assets and their respective warranties, and we will strive to provide 
timely reminders and assistance in procuring renewals as needed. 
In instances where we determine any Support Requests to be outside the scope of this Agreement due to the absence of a valid 
manufacturer or vendor support agreement, we will seek your approval before undertaking any work. The requirements for support, 
warranty, and maintenance agreements may change over the course of our professional relationship under this Agreement. We will 
promptly communicate any change to these requirements to your primary IT contact.

### Section 10
The process for logging Service Requests is outlined in Our General Terms and Conditions as referenced in the General Section of this 
Agreement. Critical and High Priority Service Requests must be logged via phone only, otherwise, Our Response Time Guarantee will only 
be applicable at Our Medium priority level for these requests. It’s important You and Your team follow this process to ensure You are 
guaranteed to receive the support at the levels We have promised. You agree to make sure Your team is aware of any restrictions You 
have in place regarding who is authorized to log Service Requests, as all requests received by us will be chargeable and/ 
or allocated against this Agreement.

### Section 11
You agree to allow Us full and free access to Your computers, and associated equipment. Your premises and Your team for the purposes 
of providing the Services in this Agreement. If there is anything that interferes with our access, we may in our absolute discretion charge 
You for any extra time incurred.

### Section 12
You agree to designate from Your team a Primary IT Contact (should the primary not be available, You will provide a designated contact 
person to serve in their absence)  
When issues of Critical and High Priority are happening, your Team is to channel all communication through this person during business 
hours. This allows Our team to work most effectively in restoring Your services as fast as possible, instead of fielding calls from multiple 
sources about the same problem. The Primary IT Contact is to inform all staff at these times, to ensure fast resolutions. The role of the 
Primary IT Contact is to also assist Our team to be the eyes and hands onsite, to allow them to remotely diagnose and solve issues in the 
fastest possible manner. You will be asked to provide the details of your designated Primary IT Contact during your 
Onboarding process, and you agree to update us if and when this Contact changes during the Term of this Agreement. 
 
THIRD-PARTY AUTHORIZATIONS 
In order to be able to assist You quickly in times of need, You need to make sure We are authorized to work with all of Your external 
Vendors that We may require to work with to provide you with Our Service.  
 
This includes but is not limited to Your Internet Service Provider, Your Web and Domain Hosting Provider, and Your Telephony 
Provider. During your Onboarding process, We will run through it with You to determine all the Vendors You will need to give authorization 
to. You can use the template found in Appendix F to assist. If We are not Authorized for a particular Vendor, We may in Our absolute 

discretion, charge You extra for any time it takes us to obtain authorization for Us to deal with that Vendor on Your behalf when needed. If 
You start working with any new Vendors that We will need to interact with after We start work on this Agreement, You agree to make sure 
that We are authorized to act on Your behalf on the commencement of Your relationship with the new Vendor.
