Terms & Conditions
This quotation is preliminary in nature and actual invoice amount may vary based on the actual number of users, applications, servers and storage required.
Actual quantities billed will be based on metered usage at the rates provided in this estimate. All subscriptions are on a month-to-month basis unless
otherwise noted. Citrix User Subscriptions and Virtual Data Center subscriptions include the first 30 days of service, free of charge for pilot purposes. After 30
days billing will begin based upon the quantity of services provisioned. Microsoft Cloud Services begin accruing charges immediately upon provisioning and
are therefore provisioned at the end of the pilot period pending your acceptance of the service.
