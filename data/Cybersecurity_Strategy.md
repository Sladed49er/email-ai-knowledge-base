 Insurance – Cybersecurity Strategy Write-Up
The proposal from Cyber Assurance Group regarding Checklight identifies valid concerns regarding 's current cybersecurity posture, such as fragmented oversight, inconsistent compliance, and the absence of a unified incident response strategy. However, rather than layering another fragmented solution on top of existing systems, a more strategic, enterprise-level approach is required.

Enterprise-grade solutions like CrowdStrike Falcon, Sophos Intercept X, and Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) provide robust, unified cybersecurity platforms that offer superior endpoint detection, real-time response capabilities, and strong ecosystem integrations. These platforms are proven at scale, widely adopted by enterprises, and capable of supporting compliance and governance needs across diverse environments.

 currently operates with cybersecurity protocols through Radius180 for BCA, Archway for , and additional third-party vendors for other entities like Beth Block. The leadership has acknowledged this decentralized model and expressed the desire to consolidate systems under a single, consistently managed framework. This aligns directly with the proposed top-down approach, which aims to unify the organization’s cybersecurity strategy starting at the tenant level and working down through each business unit.
Unifying Microsoft 365 tenants (and G Suite, where applicable) into a single organizational tenant with subdomains allows  to enforce global security policies while retaining the flexibility and familiarity of current IT operations. This method enables centralized deployment of tools like Microsoft Defender ATP, Intune, and Conditional Access across all entities, creating consistency without disrupting existing vendor relationships. IT vendors such as Radius180 and Archway remain essential partners—this strategy simply provides them with a common security framework and governance model from which to operate.

By working with a trusted enterprise security partner (e.g., TPx) to manage licenses, compliance monitoring, and reporting,  can maintain control while streamlining operations across its growing organization. Starting from the top enables broad protection through scalable rollouts, ensures compliance, and simplifies audits.

Summary: Why Top-Down Works
This proposed top-down cybersecurity strategy offers several strategic advantages:

1. Unify Microsoft and G Suite Tenants under a subdomain-based architecture for centralized control.
2. Deploy enterprise-class endpoint and identity protection (CrowdStrike, Sophos, Microsoft ATP) with scalable, policy-driven management.
3. Use a third-party compliance partner (e.g., TPx) to manage licensing, reporting, and enforcement—offloading internal overhead.
4. Retain and empower current IT vendors, who can now execute within a standardized security and compliance framework.
5. Expand phishing mitigation and training to all agencies, building on existing BullPhish efforts.

This approach improves ’s overall cybersecurity posture, reduces risk, and supports continued acquisition growth. Importantly, it aligns with ’s stated goal: a consistently managed cybersecurity umbrella led from the top—with operational continuity, compliance readiness, and enterprise-grade protection at its core.
